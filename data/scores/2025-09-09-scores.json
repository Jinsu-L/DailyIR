        "abstract": "Accurate inference of user intent is crucial for enhancing document retrieval\nin modern search engines. While large language models (LLMs) have made\nsignificant strides in this area, their effectiveness has predominantly been\nassessed with short, keyword-based queries. As AI-driven search evolves,\nlong-form queries with intricate intents are becoming more prevalent, yet they\nremain underexplored in the context of LLM-based query understanding (QU). To\nbridge this gap, we introduce ReDI: a Reasoning-enhanced approach for query\nunderstanding through Decomposition and Interpretation. ReDI leverages the\nreasoning and comprehension capabilities of LLMs in a three-stage pipeline: (i)\nit breaks down complex queries into targeted sub-queries to accurately capture\nuser intent; (ii) it enriches each sub-query with detailed semantic\ninterpretations to improve the query-document matching; and (iii) it\nindependently retrieves documents for each sub-query and employs a fusion\nstrategy to aggregate the results for the final ranking. We compiled a\nlarge-scale dataset of real-world complex queries from a major search engine\nand distilled the query understanding capabilities of teacher models into\nsmaller models for practical application. Experiments on BRIGHT and BEIR\ndemonstrate that ReDI consistently surpasses strong baselines in both sparse\nand dense retrieval paradigms, affirming its effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses\n(hallucinations) when faced with questions beyond their knowledge scope.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by leveraging external\nknowledge, but a critical challenge remains: determining whether retrieved\ncontexts effectively enhance the model`s ability to answer specific queries.\nThis challenge underscores the importance of knowledge boundary awareness,\nwhich current methods-relying on discrete labels or limited signals-fail to\naddress adequately, as they overlook the rich information in LLMs` continuous\ninternal hidden states. To tackle this, we propose a novel post-retrieval\nknowledge filtering approach. First, we construct a confidence detection model\nbased on LLMs` internal hidden states to quantify how retrieved contexts\nenhance the model`s confidence. Using this model, we build a preference dataset\n(NQ_Rerank) to fine-tune a reranker, enabling it to prioritize contexts\npreferred by the downstream LLM during reranking. Additionally, we introduce\nConfidence-Based Dynamic Retrieval (CBDR), which adaptively triggers retrieval\nbased on the LLM`s initial confidence in the original question, reducing\nknowledge conflicts and improving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in accuracy for context screening and end-to-end RAG\nperformance, along with a notable reduction in retrieval costs while\nmaintaining competitive accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Spotify has recently introduced audiobooks as part of its catalog,\ncomplementing its music and podcast offering. Search is often the first entry\npoint for users to access new items, and an important goal for Spotify is to\nsupport users in the exploration of the audiobook catalog. More specifically,\nwe would like to enable users without a specific item in mind to broadly search\nby topic, genre, story tropes, decade, and discover audiobooks, authors and\npublishers they may like. To do this, we need to 1) inspire users to type more\nexploratory queries for audiobooks and 2) augment our retrieval systems to\nbetter deal with exploratory audiobook queries. This is challenging in a\ncold-start scenario, where we have a retrievabiliy bias due to the little\namount of user interactions with audiobooks compared to previously available\nitems such as music and podcast content. To address this, we propose\nAudioBoost, a system to boost audiobook retrievability in Spotify's Search via\nsynthetic query generation. AudioBoost leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto generate synthetic queries conditioned on audiobook metadata. The synthetic\nqueries are indexed both in the Query AutoComplete (QAC) and in the Search\nRetrieval engine to improve query formulation and retrieval at the same time.\nWe show through offline evaluation that synthetic queries increase\nretrievability and are of high quality. Moreover, results from an online A/B\ntest show that AudioBoost leads to a +0.7% in audiobook impressions, +1.22% in\naudiobook clicks, and +1.82% in audiobook exploratory query completions.",

        "abstract": "Modern search systems play a crucial role in facilitating information\nacquisition. Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded\narchitecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and\nranking stages. The complexity of designing and maintaining multiple modules\nmakes it difficult to achieve holistic performance gains. Recent advances in\ngenerative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative\nsearch as an alternative. However, existing approaches are not genuinely\nend-to-end: they typically train an item encoder to tokenize candidates first\nand then optimize a generator separately, leading to objective inconsistency\nand limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniSearch,\na unified generative search framework for Kuaishou Search. UniSearch replaces\nthe cascaded pipeline with an end-to-end architecture that integrates a Search\nGenerator and a Video Encoder. The Generator produces semantic identifiers of\nrelevant items given a user query, while the Video Encoder learns latent item\nembeddings and provides their tokenized representations. A unified training\nframework jointly optimizes both components, enabling mutual enhancement and\nimproving representation quality and generation accuracy. Furthermore, we\nintroduce Search Preference Optimization (SPO), which leverages a reward model\nand real user feedback to better align generation with user preferences.\nExtensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets, together with online A/B\ntesting in both short-video and live search scenarios, demonstrate the strong\neffectiveness and deployment potential of UniSearch. Notably, its deployment in\nlive search yields the largest single-experiment improvement in recent years of\nour product's history, highlighting its practical value for real-world\napplications.",

        "abstract": "The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward\nagentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for\nretrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing\nopen-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities\non complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify\nthat the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information\nseeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic\ndata generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,\nlong-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer\npairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By\nleveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced\nweb agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by\nreinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100\ntool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse\ninformation-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able\nto effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving\nhigher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best\nperformance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.\nBeyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong\ngeneralization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on\nknowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a\npractical path toward long-horizon web agents.",

In this\nwork, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a\nset of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,\nand synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from\nverifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard\ntraining examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover\nminority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.\nEmpirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and\nreward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks.

        "title": "Outcome-based Exploration for LLM Reasoning",
        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving\nthe reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,\nwhich rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields\nsubstantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation\ndiversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is\ncritical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL\npost-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce\neffective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our\nstudy highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,\nwhere reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and\n(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a\nlimited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose\noutcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final\noutcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,\nwhich encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch\nexploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time\ndiversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models\ndemonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity\ncollapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based\nexploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these\ncontributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning\nwithout sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.",

We propose\n\\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that\nenforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric\nspans are emitted as \\emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a\nverifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,\nrounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places\nverification in the \\emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers\nare marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation\nprevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and\nprove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and\nmonotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,\nintegrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with\ncryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before\ndisplay, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:\n\\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates\nuncertainty.",

        "abstract": "Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to\ngenerate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many\ndomains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low\nhallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\ntest-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive\nbenchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not\nconsistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more\nhallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination\nbehavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model\nchoosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual\nrecall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on\npreviously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case\nstudies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to\noverconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that\ncompared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data\nare available at https://github.com/XuZhao0/tts-knowledge",

This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as\ninput-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true\ncontribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a\nparameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE\nintroduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing\nof attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the\nmagnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,\nthese modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and\nfuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled\npolicy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,\nmaking it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA\nbenchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces\nhallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest\noverhead.

This study introduces a\nnovel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM)\nClaude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which\ncontain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world\ndata distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs\nwere analyzed for insider threats by both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with\ntheir performance evaluated through statistical metrics including precision,\nrecall, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across\nnearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving\ndetection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in\nsynthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.",

        "title": "Anchoring Refusal Direction: Mitigating Safety Risks in Tuning via Projection Constraint",
        "abstract": "Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective\npost-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise\nLLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,\nraising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this\ninsight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,\nwhich we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To\nmitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a\nprojection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of\neach training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis\nshows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the\nrefusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by\noverall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our\nobservation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we\nintroduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and\nbroaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an\nenhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,\nand LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks\nposed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong\nbaselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.\nCrucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the\nr-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration\nof LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety\nresearch.",

        "abstract": "Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by\ncoordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool\nuse, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,\nand Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains\nimpractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such\nas search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers\nfrom imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.\nPreference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,\noff-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective\ntrade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human\ndefined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled\ncomparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction\nresearch by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,\nrecovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence\non such human priors and rater biases.\n  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations\nof deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three\naxes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research\ncovering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit\ndesign, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)\nagentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture\nand coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,\nVQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks.

To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large\ndataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in\nteacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus\n(TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations,\nallowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how\ninterest evolves over extended dialogues.

We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can\npredict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters)\nfine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like\nGPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model\nengagement in educational settings.

        "abstract": "Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning\nand tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,\nespecially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.\nSuch capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One\nsuch application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and\nreasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development\nof native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling\nand Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up\npre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an\nautonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on\ncontext, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training\nrecipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement\nlearning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills\nwhile preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL\nrecipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source\nLLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam\nbenchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more\ninsights into our methodologies.",
