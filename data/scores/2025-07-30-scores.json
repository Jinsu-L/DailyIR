Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps address these\nissues by incorporating external information, yet challenges remain in visual\ncontext comprehension, multi-source retrieval, and multi-turn interactions. To\naddress these challenges, Meta constructed the CRAG-MM benchmark and launched\nthe CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, which consists of three tasks. This\npaper describes the solutions of all tasks in Meta KDD Cup'25 from BlackPearl\nteam. We use a single model for each task, with key methods including data\naugmentation, RAG, reranking, and multi-task fine-tuning. Our solution achieve\nautomatic evaluation rankings of 3rd, 3rd, and 1st on the three tasks, and win\nsecond place in Task3 after human evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Advances in embedding models for text, image, audio, and video drive progress\nacross multiple domains, including retrieval-augmented generation,\nrecommendation systems, vehicle/person reidentification, and face recognition.\nMany applications in these domains require an efficient method to retrieve\nitems that are close to a given query in the embedding space while satisfying a\nfilter condition based on the item's attributes, a problem known as Filtered\nApproximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS). In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive survey and taxonomy of FANNS methods and analyze how they are\nbenchmarked in the literature. By doing so, we identify a key challenge in the\ncurrent FANNS landscape: the lack of diverse and realistic datasets,\nparticularly ones derived from the latest transformer-based text embedding\nmodels. To address this, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of embedding\nvectors for the abstracts of over 2.7 million research articles from the arXiv\nrepository, accompanied by 11 real-world attributes such as authors and\ncategories. We benchmark a wide range of FANNS methods on our novel dataset and\nfind that each method has distinct strengths and limitations; no single\napproach performs best across all scenarios. ACORN, for example, supports\nvarious filter types and performs reliably across dataset scales but is often\noutperformed by more specialized methods. SeRF shows excellent performance for\nrange filtering on ordered attributes but cannot handle categorical attributes.\nFiltered-DiskANN and UNG excel on the medium-scale dataset but fail on the\nlarge-scale dataset, highlighting the challenge posed by transformer-based\nembeddings, which are often more than an order of magnitude larger than earlier\nembeddings.

        "abstract": "In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural\nappropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide\ndiverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real\nrecipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language\nmodels (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can\ngenerate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to\noverly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to\nproduce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This\nreveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:\nit fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To\naddress this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for\ncross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and\ncontext organization.

Our approach leverages sentence-transformer embeddings to\ngroup items into semantically coherent clusters through an online algorithm\nwith dynamic thresholding, thereby creating a structured representation of the\ncontent space. Building upon this clustering foundation, we propose a novel\nexploration mechanism that empowers users to control recommendation diversity\nby strategically sampling from less-engaged clusters, thus expanding their\ncontent horizons while preserving relevance. Experiments on the MovieLens\ndataset demonstrate the system's effectiveness, showing that exploration\nsignificantly reduces intra-list similarity from 0.34 to 0.26 while\nsimultaneously increasing unexpectedness to 0.73. Furthermore, our Large\nLanguage Model-based A/B testing methodology, conducted with 300 simulated\nusers, reveals that 72.7% of long-term users prefer exploratory recommendations\nover purely exploitative ones, providing strong evidence for the system's\nability to promote meaningful content discovery without sacrificing user\nsatisfaction.",

        "abstract": "Modern analytical pipelines routinely deploy multiple deep learning and\nretrieval models that rely on approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) indexes to\nsupport efficient similarity-based search. While many state-of-the-art\nANN-indexes are memory-based (e.g., HNSW and IVF), using multiple ANN indexes\ncreates a competition for limited GPU/CPU memory resources, which in turn\nnecessitates disk-based index structures (e.g., DiskANN or eCP). In typical\nindex implementations, the main component is a complex data structure that is\nserialized to disk and is read either fully at startup time, for memory-based\nindexes, or incrementally at query time, for disk-based indexes. To visualize\nthe index structure, or analyze its quality, complex coding is needed that is\neither embedded in the index implementation or replicates the code that reads\nthe data structure. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach that\nmaps the data structure to a file structure, using a file library, making the\nindex easily readable for any programming language and even human-readable. The\ndisadvantage is that the serialized index is verbose, leading to overhead of\nsearching through the index. The question addressed in this paper is how severe\nthis performance penalty is. To that end, this paper presents eCP-FS, a\nfile-based implementation of eCP, a well-known disk-based ANN index. A\ncomparison with state-of-the-art indexes shows that while eCP-FS is slower, the\nimplementation is nevertheless somewhat competitive even when memory is not\nconstrained. In a memory-constrained scenario, eCP-FS offers a minimal memory\nfootprint, making it ideal for resource-constrained or multi-index\nenvironments.",

        "abstract": "AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated\nretrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates\nwhether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to\nimprove both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that\nautomatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based\nclinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site\ndiagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649\nelectronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for\nextracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to\nmeasure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that\nclinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance\nin high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are\nlimited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also\nleads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were\nconsistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This\nsuggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance\nand are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is\noptimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports\nrather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,\ntraining models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify\nrationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as\nadditional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only\nslightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale\ncoverage) compared to training on additional reports.",

        "abstract": "This full research paper investigates the impact of generative AI (GenAI) on\nthe learner experience, with a focus on how learners engage with and utilize\nthe information it provides. In e-learning environments, learners often need to\nnavigate a complex information space on their own. This challenge is further\ncompounded in interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics, due to the varied\nprior knowledge and backgrounds. In this paper, we studied how GenAI influences\ninformation search in bioinformatics research: (1) How do interactions with a\nGenAI chatbot influence learner orienteering behaviors?; and (2) How do\nlearners identify information scent in GenAI chatbot responses? We adopted an\nautoethnographic approach to investigate these questions. GenAI was found to\nsupport orienteering once a learning plan was established, but it was\ncounterproductive prior to that. Moreover, traditionally value-rich information\nsources such as bullet points and related terms proved less effective when\napplied to GenAI responses. Information scents were primarily recognized\nthrough the presence or absence of prior knowledge of the domain. These\nfindings suggest that GenAI should be adopted into e-learning environments with\ncaution, particularly in interdisciplinary learning contexts.",

        "abstract": "Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of\nmore complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.\nLarge language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities\nand have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to\nSPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process\nis. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for\ninvestigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are\nactually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying\ndifficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for\nverbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order\nto test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given\nthat they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to\nwhat degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they\n\"understand\" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different\nsizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as\nfine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades\nfrom $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the\nsamples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the\nmodel in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of\nlowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and\ncompositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.",

This insight holds for even learning factual\nknowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this\nwork, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized\ndata. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the\nmodel first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a\nsemantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on\na small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8\nLLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the\nsemantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,\nsemantically aligned latent representations between the two.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\ndiverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized\napplications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is\ntime-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the\nlabel-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging\ntask-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is\nmarkedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our\napproach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts\nare often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying\nlevels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple\nyet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an\ninverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or\nbetter than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being\nsignificantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,\nour experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better\naccuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\\% increase in MMLU score).\nAcross various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our\nalgorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing\nmethods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\\%.",

        "abstract": "Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network\narchitectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their\ninterpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast,\nbiological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e.,\nengrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated\nsparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we\nintroduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture\nincorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity\nand sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models\nmemory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving\ntransparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We\nevaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit\nclassification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language\nmodeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and\ngeneralization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM\narchitectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on\nthe large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant\nenhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian\ntrace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory\nformation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired\nmechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep\nlearning models.",

        "abstract": "The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)\nrapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency\nmethods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,\noffering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE\n(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method\nfor accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student\nframework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen\nreference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes\nper-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving\naverage (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive\ndifficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens\nwhile bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly\nreducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when\napplied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on\nMVBench up to 2$\\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional\ntraining, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all\nwhile reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be\nreleased soon.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as\npowerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about\nembedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their\ntraining data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal\nconsequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which\nLLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.\nSpecifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in\ninternational survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three\ncomplementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by\nmodels versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment\nanalyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM\noutputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative\nprompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that\ncurrent LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral\nvariation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with\nempirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more\nrobust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in\nLLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible\ndevelopment and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical\nalignment.",

This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,\ndesigned to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate\nits performance against traditional machine learning models and implement\nsemi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use\nLIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making\nprocess, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy\nscore of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to\nour trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of\ntransformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the\ndoor to further improvements in this area.",
