        "abstract": "We investigate the exploitation of both lexical and neural relevance signals\nfor ad-hoc passage retrieval. Our exploration involves a large-scale training\ndataset in which dense neural representations of MS-MARCO queries and passages\nare complemented and integrated with 253 hand-crafted lexical features\nextracted from the same corpus. Blending of the relevance signals from the two\ndifferent groups of features is learned by a classical Learning-to-Rank (LTR)\nmodel based on a forest of decision trees. To evaluate our solution, we employ\na pipelined architecture where a dense neural retriever serves as the first\nstage and performs a nearest-neighbor search over the neural representations of\nthe documents. Our LTR model acts instead as the second stage that re-ranks the\nset of candidates retrieved by the first stage to enhance effectiveness. The\nresults of reproducible experiments conducted with state-of-the-art dense\nretrievers on publicly available resources show that the proposed solution\nsignificantly enhances the end-to-end ranking performance while relatively\nminimally impacting efficiency. Specifically, we achieve a boost in nDCG@10 of\nup to 11% with an increase in average query latency of only 4.3%. This confirms\nthe advantage of seamlessly combining two distinct families of signals that\nmutually contribute to retrieval effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "The whole-page reranking plays a critical role in shaping the user experience\nof search engines, which integrates retrieval results from multiple modalities,\nsuch as documents, images, videos, and LLM outputs. Existing methods mainly\nrely on large-scale human-annotated data, which is costly to obtain and\ntime-consuming. This is because whole-page annotation is far more complex than\nsingle-modal: it requires assessing the entire result page while accounting for\ncross-modal relevance differences. Thus, how to improve whole-page reranking\nperformance while reducing annotation costs is still a key challenge in\noptimizing search engine result pages(SERP). In this paper, we propose SMAR, a\nnovel whole-page reranking framework that leverages strong Single-modal rankers\nto guide Modal-wise relevance Alignment for effective Reranking, using only\nlimited whole-page annotation to outperform fully-annotated reranking models.\nSpecifically, high-quality single-modal rankers are first trained on data\nspecific to their respective modalities. Then, for each query, we select a\nsubset of their outputs to construct candidate pages and perform human\nannotation at the page level. Finally, we train the whole-page reranker using\nthese limited annotations and enforcing consistency with single-modal\npreferences to maintain ranking quality within each modality. Experiments on\nthe Qilin and Baidu datasets demonstrate that SMAR reduces annotation costs by\nabout 70-90\\% while achieving significant ranking improvements compared to\nbaselines. Further offline and online A/B testing on Baidu APPs also shows\nnotable gains in standard ranking metrics as well as user experience\nindicators, fully validating the effectiveness and practical value of our\napproach in real-world search scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising zero-shot rankers, but\ntheir performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. In particular,\nrole-play prompts, where the model is assigned a functional role or identity,\noften give more robust and accurate relevance rankings. However, the mechanisms\nand diversity of role-play effects remain underexplored, limiting both\neffective use and interpretability. In this work, we systematically examine how\nrole-play variations influence zero-shot LLM rankers. We employ causal\nintervention techniques from mechanistic interpretability to trace how\nrole-play information shapes relevance judgments in LLMs. Our analysis reveals\nthat (1) careful formulation of role descriptions have a large effect on the\nranking quality of the LLM; (2) role-play signals are predominantly encoded in\nearly layers and communicate with task instructions in middle layers, while\nreceiving limited interaction with query or document representations.\nSpecifically, we identify a group of attention heads that encode information\ncritical for role-conditioned relevance. These findings not only shed light on\nthe inner workings of role-play in LLM ranking but also offer guidance for\ndesigning more effective prompts in IR and beyond, pointing toward broader\nopportunities for leveraging role-play in zero-shot applications.",

        "title": "Rethinking On-policy Optimization for Query Augmentation",
        "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of\ninterest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main\napproaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or\npseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's\nparametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies\nreinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly\noptimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and\nlimitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent\nexperimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic\ncomparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse\nbenchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key\nfinding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par\nwith, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when\nusing powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid\nmethod, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of\nrewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that\nmaximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative\nstructure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE\noutperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating\nthat a synergistic approach yields the best results.

Modeling such rich contextual signals and\ntheir intricate associations with candidate items remains a key challenge.\nAlthough numerous efforts have been devoted to building more effective search\nmethods, existing approaches still show limitations in integrating contextual\ninformation, which hinders their ability to fully capture user intent.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware reasoning-enhanced\ngenerative search framework for better \\textbf{understanding the complicated\ncontext}.

To overcome the lack of explicit reasoning trajectories, we\nintroduce a self-evolving post-training paradigm that iteratively combines\nsupervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to progressively enhance the\nmodel's reasoning capability. In addition, we identify potential biases in\nexisting RL algorithms when applied to search scenarios and present a debiased\nvariant of GRPO to improve ranking performance.

        "title": "Towards Mixed-Modal Retrieval for Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for\nenhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an\nexternal corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text\ndocuments, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and\ndocuments may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this\npaper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to\nimprove vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified\nmixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate\nthe scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated\npipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct\nNyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that\nbetter reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality\ndataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform\npre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets,\nfollowed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream\nvision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative\npreferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs\ncompetitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more\ngeneral and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality\nin vision-language tasks.",

We\npresent UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid\naction -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic\ntool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an\nautomated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,\nopen-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine\nproducing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use\nscenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection\nwith both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)\na two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online\nreinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and\nhigh-level actions.

In this paper, we first evaluate search\nagents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce\nharmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track\nsomeone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a\nsearch agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal\nthreshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize\nthem into an informative yet unsafe summary.

Examples of target properties $T$ include the\nbinary flag that triggers an LLM's harmful response or rejection, and the\ndegree to which information deleted by unlearning can be restored, both\nelicited via adversarial instructions. The LLM reveals an \\emph{observable\nsignal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response\ncontaining answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of\ninformation leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled\nguidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this\ngap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information\ncan be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods\ncome to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between\nthe observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query,\nwe show that achieving error $\\varepsilon$ requires at least\n$\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak\nrate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest\nincrease in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic\nin terms of the desired accuracy. Experiments on seven LLMs across\nsystem-prompt leakage, jailbreak, and relearning attacks corroborate the\ntheory: exposing answer tokens alone requires about a thousand queries; adding\nlogits cuts this to about a hundred; and revealing the full thinking process\ntrims it to a few dozen. Our results provide the first principled yardstick for\nbalancing transparency and security when deploying LLMs.",

We present the first systematic investigation of \"chameleon\nbehavior\" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with\ncontradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in\nsearch-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising\n17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn\nconversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in\nstate-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the\nChameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use\nRate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of\nLlama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent\nfailures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511),\nwith GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small\nacross-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a\nsampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations\nbetween source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes\n(r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that\nlimited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query\nframing.

Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable\ncode, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent\ntechnical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches\ntend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured\nknowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To\novercome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a\nmodular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical\ninsights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from\nscientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two\ndifferent LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on\nPaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible\nsolution for automated AI research replication.

However, LLMs\nremain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability\nto retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external\nevidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic,\nlacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in\nagentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve,\nand reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within\nthis paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for\nadaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first\ncomprehensive overview of \\emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the\nemerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for\n(functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii)\nWhere RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative\nmethods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges\nand future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic\nsearch systems.

We introduce a Resolution-Aware\nRetrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by\nleveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By\ndecomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs\nresolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader\nspatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences.\nThis allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new\nlocations with minimal historical context.\n  Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms\ntraditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and\nmodern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34%\nlower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset.\n  Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and\nresolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution\nfor zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.",

Regarding the inherent relation-dependency\nand reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into\ntwo categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question,\ni.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent\nsub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding\nsequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as\nessential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning\napproaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact\nverification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former\nexcels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning\ntasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning\nbut suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel\nfact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and\naccuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\ndual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by\nthe Dual Process Theory in cognitive science.

        "abstract": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by\ndetecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot\nperformance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often\ncompromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical\ndownstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish\nbetween fine-grained classes such as \"fishing boat\" and \"yacht\" since their\nembeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user\ngoals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.\nTo address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad\ngeneralization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot\nclassifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate\nhigh-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high\nprecision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of\nuser-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery\nannotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning\nstrategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME\nidentifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision\nboundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample\ndiversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without\ncostly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then\na minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our\nmethod consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,\nestablishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting\nfoundation models to specific user needs.",

        "abstract": "Legal reasoning is a fundamental component of legal analysis and\ndecision-making. Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning\npredominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC,\nwhich do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal\nreasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases,\nwith insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel\nframework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese\ntort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes\nused in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module\nreasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained\nsub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort\nlegal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to\nsystematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for\ntort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large\nlanguage models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our\nresults indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling\ncrucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several\nbaseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning\nthrough prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on\nadditional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and\nCriminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these\nbaselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in\ntort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis\ntasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning\nchains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models.",

        "abstract": "Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced\nreasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement\nframeworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems,\ntheir effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction\ncapabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This\nwork demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities\non hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially\nextended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning\n(DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step\nrepresents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is\nthat convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability\nof improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple\nlong-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small\npositive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct\nanswers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On\nthe challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously\nunsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model\nto surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through\nmajority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER\nframework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight\nreasoners.

The findings reveal a clear\ndominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,\nand significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed\nacross outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a\nhuman-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers\nrecognize hidden affective framing in daily news.",

        "title": "On Efficiency-Effectiveness Trade-off of Diffusion-based Recommenders",
        "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative\nsequential recommendation, which typically generate next items to recommend\nguided by user interaction histories with a multi-step denoising process.\nHowever, the multi-step process relies on discrete approximations, introducing\ndiscretization error that creates a trade-off between computational efficiency\nand recommendation effectiveness. To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec,\na two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the\ndenoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by\naligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the\nefficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains\nthe denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing\nthe consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we\ncan smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step\nwith bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces\nAdaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user\npreference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps.\nExtensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively\nmitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both\nefficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.",

        "abstract": "The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted\ndecision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs).\nAlong with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred\nincreasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning\napproaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model\nutility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated\nresponses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive\napplications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)\nframework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)\ncontext-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens\nwithout disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant\nresponse shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about\nunlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level\ninterventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning\nset to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention\nenhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in\nthe retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components\nare jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary\nthat localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under\nrepresentation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves\nperformance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods,\nachieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC\nbenchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning\neffectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance\nbetween unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.",

In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and\nuncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype\nrepetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary\njustification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or\nintroduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these\ninsights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that\nqueries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific\nfailure patterns.

Despite its\nsuccesses, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid\nsearching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number\nof prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer\nfindings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by\nits absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention\ninterplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating\ninstance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the\nprompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we\nfind an interesting phenomenon, namely \"attention anchor\", that incorporating\ninstance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully\npreserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more\nactive attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our\nobservation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and\neffective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics\ninto prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both\ninstance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner\n(i.e., one single capsule prompt).

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to\nexpansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon\nfootprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the\nredundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of\ntokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this\ninefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework\nfor LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens.\nLeveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX,\nwe assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to\npreserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse\nfrugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment\nAnalysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a\nsuite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction\nincurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that\ncontemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In\ncontrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply,\nreflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis\nwith bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns\nthat may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may\nresort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional\nNLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding\nof LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the\nboundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring\nexhaustive context.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a\nwell-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the\ncontext of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that\nextrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a\nstep further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and\nlinguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight\nclassifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs,\nour method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset,\noutperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach.\nFurthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary\nrelevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we\nconduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even\nwithout task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal\nproficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential\nas a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.",

        "title": "Towards Low-Resource Alignment to Diverse Perspectives with Sparse Feedback",
        "abstract": "As language models have a greater impact on society, it is important to\nensure they are aligned to a diverse range of perspectives and are able to\nreflect nuance in human values. However, the most popular training paradigms\nfor modern language models often assume there is one optimal answer for every\nquery, leading to generic responses and poor alignment. In this work, we aim to\nenhance pluralistic alignment of language models in a low-resource setting with\ntwo methods: pluralistic decoding and model steering. We empirically\ndemonstrate that model steering offers consistent improvement over zero-shot\nand few-shot baselines with only 50 annotated samples. Our proposed methods\ndecrease false positives in several high-stakes tasks such as hate speech\ndetection and misinformation detection, and improves the distributional\nalignment to human values in GlobalOpinionQA. We hope our work highlights the\nimportance of diversity and how language models can be adapted to consider\nnuanced perspectives.",

        "abstract": "Training and evaluation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) web agents have gained\nincreasing attention, yet a scalable and efficient environment that couples\nrealistic and robust browser-side interaction with controllable server-side\nstate at scale is still missing. Existing environments tend to have one or more\nof the following issues: they overwhelm policy models with excessive and noisy\ncontext; they perform actions non-deterministically without waiting for the UI\nor network to stabilize; or they cannot scale isolated client-server containers\neffectively for parallel RL rollouts. We propose WEBSERV, an environment that\nincludes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context\nand action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching\nand resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We\nevaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving\nstate-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by\n~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling\n200+ concurrent containers on a single host.",

        "title": "Mapping Post-Training Forgetting in Language Models at Scale",
        "abstract": "Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in\nlanguage models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly\nunderstood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.\npresident or an API call) does not \"average out\" by recalling another. Hence,\nwe propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when\nbackward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before\npost-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to\nquantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects\nand obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add\nchance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random\nguessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across\npost-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis\nshows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with\nlow-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base\nmodels and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on\nmath and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to\ninstruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both\nforgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed\nand warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not\nreliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical\nyardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --\nenabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.",
