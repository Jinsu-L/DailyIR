        "abstract": "We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language\nmodels designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale\nmodel training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models\ntrained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training\npipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality\nclassifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of\nintermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and\ncontamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We\nfind that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence\nbut yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --\ncontinuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers\ncompetitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss\nhow usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To\nsupport further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during\npretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly\nreleasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a\nreproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,\nevaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question\nanswering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.\nExisting post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle\nin multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers\nsynthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue\nthat post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers\nare decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first\nshow that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside\nattributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a\npost-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as\nintermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,\nannotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and\n14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.\nAcross extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves\nattribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding\nstate-of-the-art frontier models.",

Although diagrams\nare presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce\nclear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction\nis to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which\ncan leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to\nthe complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,\nsufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality\nof LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose\nDiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration\ndiagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams\nas graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed\nedges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node\nalignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate\ndiagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,\nquantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show\nhow the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable\ninsights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams.

For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with\ncalendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect\nanomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing\nlanguage agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks\nthat lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to\nevaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the\nTool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering\ndiverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable\nexecution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604\ntools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to\nprofessional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools\nare based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we\nmay have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily\nensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we\nprovide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas\ncourses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark\nincludes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting\nwith multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is\nstrictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive\nevaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the\nbest-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate\nwith 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model\nDeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%.

        "abstract": "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and\ntheir automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite\nrecent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their\nability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of\nEHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,\nspecifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning\ninstruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M\nnon-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a\nthinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning\ndata at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced\nLLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage\ntraining paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and\nreinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and\ndiverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.\nLastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning\n42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR\nscenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including\nDeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and\nachieving a 10\\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,\nEHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more\nreliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.",

We propose a framework for\nassessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,\nintroducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as\ngenerated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic\nprogram.

Content-based Semantic IDs\n(SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However,\nby ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have\nlimited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral\ninformation but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform\ncontent features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,\ncreating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and\nlong-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise\nCorruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative\nnoise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to\nthe loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The\nequal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of\ndifferent behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to\ndistinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we\npropose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,\nDenoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior\nmodalities for semantic IDs learning.

To address this limitation, this paper\nstudies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of\ninformation asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and\nskills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein\nPuzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game.

These phonation\ntypes are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and\nsocial meaning in speech.

The PQC is unitary by construction,\nmaking the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.\nAt each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding\nand processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical\nnonlinearity.

This allows us to infer a dense,\nturn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,\ndecomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised\nlearning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action,\nstate_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,\n\\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader\nCalibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward\nmodel with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy\nof \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying\nsizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs\ninto a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,\nour model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,\nproving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,\nreal-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically\nviable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented\nLLM applications.",

        "abstract": "Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing\nvisually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a\ncoherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather\nthan describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each\nAD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To\naddress this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first\ngenerates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then\nperforms auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and\ninformative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a\nsequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs\nconvey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture\nthe redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD\nsequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches\nthat rely on independent generations.",

Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are\nonly text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can\nreliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we\ninvestigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing\nsix metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one\nhand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA\nzero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the\nconsistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:\nparaphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence\nlength. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and\ndemonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic\nequivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias\ntoward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to\ndetect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and\nLLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This\nmotivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond\ntext-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.",

This study examines\nLLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and\nwhether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show\nthat larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while\nsmaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,\nimplicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and\nquality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.\nOverall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded\nprompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually\nnuanced communication.

Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the\ncontext of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nthe first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to\nreduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality.

Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we\nassess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset\nfor German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines\nand evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,\nslightly noisy data.

While they\nhave also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the\nhallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior\nstudies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce\nbibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is\ngenerated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear\nin the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume\ncitation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency\nwith which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the\npretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated\nreferences in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified\n100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured\nfactual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic\nmetadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across\nresearch domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual\naccuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly\nmemorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that\nhighly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a\nthreshold where generalization shifts into memorization.",

Traditional expert-based methods struggle to\nkeep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.\nIn this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence\nof transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological\nconvergence.\n  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract\nsemantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of\ntechnology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for\ngrouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop\ngraph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes\nmulti-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend\nanalysis of topic co-occurence.\n  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv\npreprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO\npatent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.\nOur results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both\nestablished and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and\ngeneralizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text\nanalysis.",

We introduce Graph-based Agent\nPlanning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task\ndependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and\nserial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose\ncomplex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining\nwhich tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential\ndependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial\nimprovements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy.

First, the\nseparation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,\nautoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we\npropose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address\nthe two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an\nautoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic\nautoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we\npre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter\ninitialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating\nsequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we\npropose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient\nautoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),\nwhich trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items\nwhile preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time\nrecommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF\noutperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is\nnearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also\nbeen deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily\nactive users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM\ncan already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible\nprobability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path\ncan be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal\nreasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is\nthis the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it\navoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for\nexplanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a\nquestion to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to\nderive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove\nthat conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled\nreasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided\nVariational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned\nreasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments\nin both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over\nstrong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR\nreduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes\nproblem-specific strategies in reasoning.",

        "abstract": "While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is\nheavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect\ngenuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a\nsetting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.\nBuilding on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction\n(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each\nfor English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa\n(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,\nGemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The\nresults painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact\noutcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in\nSwahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story\nbecame even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nprompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,\nsignificantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and\nGemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of \"overthinking\"\nthat hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that\nChain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily\non the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our\nframework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders\ncross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.",

Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not\ninherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext.

In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that\ncan autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To\nincentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under\noutcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning\nwith an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic\ncapabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of\nhigh-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.\nThen, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it\napplies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy\nto hard.

        "abstract": "Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains\nunknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to\nidentify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two\ncategories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing\nknowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior\nwork has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of\nresearch by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted\ntwo experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a\nmanually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both\nclosed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)\nunder paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of\nimplicit gaps inference, we introduce \\textbf{\\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive\nBucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred\nconclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust\ncapability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.\nThis is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants\noften performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for\nsystematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support\nearly-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also\nreport observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,\nincluding domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking\nacross open- and closed-weight models.",

Recently, implicit CoT approaches have\nemerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed\n``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates\nCoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.\nHowever, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)\nthey fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning\n(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,\nresulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on\nreducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the\nconsiderable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning\ntoken. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned\nimplicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,\nwe design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic\nalignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce\nsemantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the\nsecond challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by\nfinetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This\ngenerator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth\nreasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing\nfor accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by\njointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic\nalignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both\nefficiency and effectiveness.

        "title": "Seeing Through the MiRAGE: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation",
        "abstract": "We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a\nprevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to\nintegrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing\nevaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to\nmultimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information\nagainst sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG\nevaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information\ncoverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that\nMiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality\njudgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three\nprominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the\nlimitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic\nevaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess\nmultimodal RAG.",

        "title": "Do Large Language Models Grasp The Grammar? Evidence from Grammar-Book-Guided Probing in Luxembourgish",
        "abstract": "Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural\norganization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as\nsentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language\nprocessing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation\nprotocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.\nMoreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend\ngrammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and\nmeanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar\nBook Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and\ngeneralizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,\nand in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak\npositive correlation between translation performance and grammatical\nunderstanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply\ndeep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their\nsemantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling\nparticularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a\npromising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.",
