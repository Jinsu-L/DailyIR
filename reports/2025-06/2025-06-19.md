- **Experiment**: TOPCLUSTRAG system evaluation on 500 questions, comparison with three baseline methods
- **Takeaway**: Clustering-based approach contributes meaningfully to large-scale RAG systems, achieving 2nd place in faithfulness and 7th place in correctness on the leaderboard

#### Abstract
> We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 13
- **Authors**: Yongqi Fan, Yating Wang, Guandong Wang, Jie Zhai, Jingping Liu, Qi Ye, Tong Ruan
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15215v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 07:49:13
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, listwise, pointwise, pairwise, rank
- **Reason**: The paper proposes a novel evaluation method for open-ended question answering, focusing on distinguishing factoid and non-factoid questions.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Open-Ended Question Answering Evaluation Framework
- **Aim**: To develop a novel evaluation framework, MinosEval, for open-ended question answering systems based on large language models
- **Rationale**: Existing evaluation approaches have limitations, such as not distinguishing between factoid and non-factoid questions, and MinosEval addresses these limitations by employing tailored evaluation strategies
- **Ground**: MinosEval uses adaptive key-point scoring for factoid questions and instance-aware listwise ranking for non-factoid questions, and is evaluated on multiple open-ended QA datasets
- **Experiment**: Comprehensive evaluation of MinosEval on various datasets, including self-built datasets, and comparison with baselines and existing methods
- **Takeaway**: MinosEval outperforms baselines, provides more interpretable results, and contributes to the advancement of LLM evaluation research, but has limitations that need to be addressed in future work

#### Abstract
> Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

### 3. Lessons from Training Grounded LLMs with Verifiable Rewards

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Shang Hong Sim, Tej Deep Pala, Vernon Toh, Hai Leong Chieu, Amir Zadeh, Chuan Li, Navonil Majumder, Soujanya Poria
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15522v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 14:58:13
- **Topic Keywords**: queries, rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper explores the training of large language models using verifiable rewards, focusing on grounding and trustworthiness. While it touches on retrieval-augmented generation, the primary focus is on language models and their ability to generate grounded and trustworthy responses. The paper's emphasis on reinforcement learning and internal reasoning is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval, but the connection is not strong enough to warrant a higher score.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Ground-GRPO: A Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning Framework for Grounding in Large Language Models
- **Aim**: To enhance the grounding of responses in large language models for question answering tasks
- **Rationale**: Current instruction-tuned LLMs struggle with generating factually reliable and grounded responses, and Ground-GRPO addresses these limitations
- **Ground**: The framework focuses on three key aspects of grounding: Answer Correctness, Citation Quality, and Refusal
- **Experiment**: The experimental setup involves training on the Trust-Align SFT dataset with LLaMA3.1-8B, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-8B models, showing significant improvements in grounding compared to instruction-tuned models
- **Takeaway**: Combining distillation with GRPO and process-level supervision through Trust-Align leads to improved groundedness and reliability of language models in QA tasks

#### Abstract
> Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Zihao Li, Qiang Chen, Lixin Zou, Aixin Sun, Chenliang Li
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15284v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 09:05:32
- **Topic Keywords**: user behavior, recommend, search
- **Reason**: The paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies, particularly in the context of recommender systems. However, the focus on multi-interest recommendation and its applications in recommendation research is not directly aligned with your primary interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The paper's relevance is limited to the overlap between recommender systems and information retrieval.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Abstract)
- **Topic**: Multi-Interest Recommendation in Recommender Systems
- **Aim**: To provide a systematic review of multi-interest recommendation, answering three key questions on its importance, focus, and application
- **Rationale**: Existing recommendation methods are limited in capturing complex and evolving user preferences, and multi-interest recommendation addresses this challenge by extracting multiple interest representations from user interactions
- **Ground**: Recommender systems
- **Experiment**: A systematic review of multi-interest recommendation, including an accompanying GitHub repository with implemented methods
- **Takeaway**: A foundational framework and overview for researchers interested in exploring multi-interest recommendation

#### Abstract
> Existing recommendation methods often struggle to model users' multifaceted
preferences due to the diversity and volatility of user behavior, as well as
the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of item attributes in practical
scenarios. Multi-interest recommendation addresses this challenge by extracting
multiple interest representations from users' historical interactions, enabling
fine-grained preference modeling and more accurate recommendations. It has
drawn broad interest in recommendation research. However, current
recommendation surveys have either specialized in frontier recommendation
methods or delved into specific tasks and downstream applications. In this
work, we systematically review the progress, solutions, challenges, and future
directions of multi-interest recommendation by answering the following three
questions: (1) Why is multi-interest modeling significantly important for
recommendation? (2) What aspects are focused on by multi-interest modeling in
recommendation? and (3) How can multi-interest modeling be applied, along with
the technical details of the representative modules? We hope that this survey
establishes a fundamental framework and delivers a preliminary overview for
researchers interested in this field and committed to further exploration. The
implementation of multi-interest recommendation summarized in this survey is
maintained at https://github.com/WHUIR/Multi-Interest-Recommendation-A-Survey.

### 5. Next-User Retrieval: Enhancing Cold-Start Recommendations via Generative Next-User Modeling

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Yu-Ting Lan, Yang Huo, Yi Shen, Xiao Yang, Zuotao Liu
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15267v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 08:42:01
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval, recommend
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on the item cold-start problem in recommendation systems, proposing a novel framework for enhancing cold-start recommendations via generative next-user modeling. While it shares some similarities with query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval, the primary focus is on recommendation systems, which is not a central match for the user's research interests.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Addressing the 'item cold-start' problem in online recommendation systems, particularly in short video platforms like Douyin
- **Aim**: To propose a novel framework called Next-User Retrieval to enhance cold-start recommendations
- **Rationale**: Traditional recommendation systems struggle with cold-start items due to their reliance on item and historical interaction data, which are scarce for new items
- **Ground**: Next-User Retrieval utilizes a transformer-based model to capture relationships between recently interacted users and generates a 'next potential user' most likely to interact with a given item
- **Experiment**: Offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate significant improvements, including increases in daily active users and publications on Douyin
- **Takeaway**: The proposed framework provides essential feedback to new items, encouraging creator engagement and ultimately leading to long-term creator retention

#### Abstract
> The item cold-start problem is critical for online recommendation systems, as
the success of this phase determines whether high-quality new items can
transition to popular ones, receive essential feedback to inspire creators, and
thus lead to the long-term retention of creators. However, modern
recommendation systems still struggle to address item cold-start challenges due
to the heavy reliance on item and historical interactions, which are
non-trivial for cold-start items lacking sufficient exposure and feedback.
Lookalike algorithms provide a promising solution by extending feedback for new
items based on lookalike users. Traditional lookalike algorithms face such
limitations: (1) failing to effectively model the lookalike users and further
improve recommendations with the existing rule- or model-based methods; and (2)
struggling to utilize the interaction signals and incorporate diverse features
in modern recommendation systems.
  Inspired by lookalike algorithms, we propose Next-User Retrieval, a novel
framework for enhancing cold-start recommendations via generative next-user
modeling. Specifically, we employ a transformer-based model to capture the
unidirectional relationships among recently interacted users and utilize these
sequences to generate the next potential user who is most likely to interact
with the item. The additional item features are also integrated as prefix
prompt embeddings to assist the next-user generation. The effectiveness of
Next-User Retrieval is evaluated through both offline experiments and online
A/B tests. Our method achieves significant improvements with increases of
0.0142% in daily active users and +0.1144% in publications in Douyin,
showcasing its practical applicability and scalability.

### 6. Advancing Loss Functions in Recommender Systems: A Comparative Study with a R√©nyi Divergence-Based Solution

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Shengjia Zhang, Jiawei Chen, Changdong Li, Sheng Zhou, Qihao Shi, Yan Feng, Chun Chen, Can Wang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15120v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 03:39:13
- **Comment**: AAAI 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, recommend
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on recommender systems and loss functions, which is somewhat related to my interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. However, the emphasis on recommender systems and the lack of direct connection to query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling make it less relevant to my core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

### 7. MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Joseph J. Peper, Wenzhao Qiu, Ali Payani, Lu Wang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-17 19:14:30
- **Comment**: ACL 2025 Findings
- **Topic Keywords**: relevance
- **Reason**: The paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on multi-document reasoning tasks, which is a relevant area in NLP. However, the focus is on LLMs and their capabilities, rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest in Information Retrieval. The paper's relevance is somewhat limited to the broader NLP and data mining domains, but does not directly align with the user's specific research themes.

#### Abstract
> Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### 8. CC-LEARN: Cohort-based Consistency Learning

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Xiao Ye, Shaswat Shrivastava, Zhaonan Li, Jacob Dineen, Shijie Lu, Avneet Ahuja, Ming Shen, Zhikun Xu, Ben Zhou
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15662v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 17:41:28
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for improving the reliability of large language models' reasoning. While it touches on retrieval and optimization, the focus is on reasoning and consistency, which is not directly related to my primary research interests in information retrieval, query understanding, and ranking models. The paper's relevance is somewhat related, but not a central match.

#### Abstract
> Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

### 9. AutoRule: Reasoning Chain-of-thought Extracted Rule-based Rewards Improve Preference Learning

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Tevin Wang, Chenyan Xiong
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15651v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 17:29:19
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper presents a method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards for reinforcement learning. While it touches on the topic of user behavior modeling, it is primarily focused on preference learning and rule extraction, which is not directly related to my core research interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. The paper's relevance is somewhat limited, but it may be of interest to me due to its connection to reinforcement learning and human feedback.

#### Abstract
> Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at
https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.

### 10. Context-Informed Grounding Supervision

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Hyunji Lee, Seunghyun Yoon, Yunjae Won, Hanseok Oh, Geewook Kim, Trung Bui, Franck Dernoncourt, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal, Minjoon Seo
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15480v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 14:13:56
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper proposes a method for improving the grounding of language models in external context, which is relevant to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the focus is on language models and their training, rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest for your research. The paper's relevance is somewhat limited to your interests, but it may still provide useful insights for your work.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

### 11. Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Ignacio Sastre, Aiala Ros√°
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15001v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-17 22:13:34
- **Comment**: This paper will be presented at The First Workshop on Large Language
  Model Memorization (L2M2) at ACL 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper explores a novel phenomenon in large language models (LLMs) where they can generate reversible sentence embeddings. While it touches on retrieval and compression, the focus is more on the model's capabilities and potential applications, rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core aspects of your research interests.

#### Abstract
> In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### 12. Capturing Polysemanticity with PRISM: A Multi-Concept Feature Description Framework

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 1
- **Authors**: Laura Kopf, Nils Feldhus, Kirill Bykov, Philine Lou Bommer, Anna Hedstr√∂m, Marina M. -C. H√∂hne, Oliver Eberle
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15538v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 15:13:07
- **Topic Keywords**: search
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on feature description and interpretability in neural networks, which is related to my interests in NLP and data mining. However, the specific problem of polysemanticity in neural network features is not directly related to my core research themes in Information Retrieval and Search technologies, such as query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

### 13. video-SALMONN 2: Captioning-Enhanced Audio-Visual Large Language Models

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 1
- **Authors**: Changli Tang, Yixuan Li, Yudong Yang, Jimin Zhuang, Guangzhi Sun, Wei Li, Zejun Ma, Chao Zhang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15220v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 07:58:41
- **Topic Keywords**: rank
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on video captioning using audio-visual large language models, which is not directly related to information retrieval or search technologies. While it involves natural language processing, the primary goal is not query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are key areas of interest for you. The paper's relevance is somewhat limited to your broader interests in NLP and data mining.

#### Abstract
> Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar
size. Codes are available at

### 14. Identifying economic narratives in large text corpora -- An integrated approach using Large Language Models

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 1
- **Authors**: Tobias Schmidt, Kai-Robin Lange, Matthias Reccius, Henrik M√ºller, Michael Roos, Carsten Jentsch
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15041v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 01:00:59
- **Comment**: 53 pages, 5 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: search
- **Reason**: The paper explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in economic narrative extraction, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and NLP. However, the focus on economic narratives and the use of LLMs for this specific task does not directly align with the user's core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 12:35:53
- **Comment**: 11 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables. Research on parameter-efficient
  fine-tuning (PEFT) for low-resource languages (Swahili). Investigates
  cross-lingual lexical alignment in Lugha-Llama using LoRA and contrastive
  learning
- **Topic Keywords**: information retrieval, rag, retrieval, rank
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on improving the lexical alignment of a language model in a low-resource language, which is not directly related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and query understanding. The paper's emphasis on language models and lexical alignment is more relevant to Natural Language Processing, but the specific application and techniques used are not closely aligned with the user's research themes.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 08:20:29
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval augmented generation, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on historical text analysis and knowledge extraction, using graph-augmented generation and chain-of-thought prompting. While it involves retrieval-augmented generation, the context is not related to information retrieval or search technologies, and the topics of query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling are not addressed.

#### Abstract
> This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

While it mentions evaluation and ranking, the context is different from the user's interests in IR and NLP.

#### Abstract
> Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 02:16:53
- **Topic Keywords**: relevance, rag
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on open-ended long-form generation and evaluation, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. While it mentions the use of BERTScore, a metric used in NLP, the paper's primary focus is on natural language generation and evaluation, rather than information retrieval or search.

#### Abstract
> Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

While it touches on multimodal scientific literature tasks, the primary focus is on evaluating models' comprehension and reasoning, rather than ranking models or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal
scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over
1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common
reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable
fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we
identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key
insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal
scientific literature tasks.

- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval, search
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on a specific problem in document understanding, using tables and charts, which is not directly related to information retrieval, query understanding, or ranking models. While it involves multimodal reasoning, the context is not relevant to the user's interests in e-commerce or real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

The paper's emphasis on task complexity, agent organization, and collaboration is not aligned with the user's research interests in IR, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

- **Topic Keywords**: queries
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on evaluating language models' knowledge of Indian culture, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. While it touches on the importance of understanding local socio-cultural contexts, the paper's scope is limited to language models and cultural knowledge, making it irrelevant to the user's primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

### 23. When and How Unlabeled Data Provably Improve In-Context Learning

- **Reason**: The paper is not directly related to Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. The focus is on in-context learning, unlabeled data, and transformers, which are not core topics in your research interests.

#### Abstract
> Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

While it involves natural language processing, the context is specific to music and does not align with the user's broader interests in IR, NLP, and data mining.

#### Abstract
> Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Although it mentions linguistic structure and entropy-based selection, the context is specific to Korean language processing and does not align with the user's research interests in IR, NLP, or data mining.

#### Abstract
> This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Although it mentions LLMs, the context is different from the user's background in e-commerce and NLP.

#### Abstract
> Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

Although it involves NLP techniques, the context is specific to medical diagnosis and not relevant to the user's primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

The paper's emphasis on large-scale models and computational demands is also not aligned with the user's interest in real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of large language models, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. While it touches on the topic of language models, the paper's scope is limited to the evaluation of these models' abilities, without any clear connection to the user's research interests in IR, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

The paper's emphasis on politeness norms and utterance cost is also outside the scope of the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

### 31. DiscoSG: Towards Discourse-Level Text Scene Graph Parsing through Iterative Graph Refinement

- **LLM Score**: 2
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Shaoqing Lin, Chong Teng, Fei Li, Donghong Ji, Lizhen Qu, Zhuang Li
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15583v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 16:00:19
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on a specific task in computer vision, namely discourse-level text scene graph parsing, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. Although it involves natural language processing, the scope is limited to a specific domain and does not align with the user's broader interests in IR, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

- **Comment**: Accepted to Interspeech 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on speech tokenization and disentangled speech representation, which is not directly related to Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or query understanding. Although it involves neural networks and knowledge distillation, the topic is more specific to speech processing and does not align with the user's primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 07:44:09
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their ability to generalize across domains through reasoning prototypes. While it touches on the idea of representation learning, the primary focus is on logical reasoning and planning, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or user behavior modeling. The paper's relevance to the user's research interests is limited.

#### Abstract
> Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

The paper focuses on natural language processing techniques for identifying social isolation themes in text narratives, which is outside the scope of your interests.

#### Abstract
> Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

- **Submitted**: 2025-06-17 20:00:16
- **Comment**: Accepted in 1st IEEE QPAIN 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper is not relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. The focus is on using Large Language Models for diabetes prediction, which is outside your primary area of interest. While it mentions some machine learning models, the context is different from your work on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

While it touches on web-scale knowledge access, the primary focus is on embodied cognition and physical-digital integration, making it an off-topic paper for your research interests.

#### Abstract
> AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly
available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on the safety of large language models and proposes a method to enhance safety robustness, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. While it touches on the topic of model fine-tuning, it does not address ranking models or user behavior modeling, making it only loosely relevant to the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15576v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-06-18 15:53:47
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on generative recommendation and proposes a novel framework called DiscRec, which disentangles semantic and collaborative signals. While it employs some NLP techniques, such as token-level modeling and attention mechanisms, the primary focus is on recommendation systems, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. The paper's relevance to the user's research interests is limited.

#### Abstract
> Generative recommendation is emerging as a powerful paradigm that directly
generates item predictions, moving beyond traditional matching-based
approaches. However, current methods face two key challenges: token-item
misalignment, where uniform token-level modeling ignores item-level granularity
that is critical for collaborative signal learning, and semantic-collaborative
signal entanglement, where collaborative and semantic signals exhibit distinct
distributions yet are fused in a unified embedding space, leading to
conflicting optimization objectives that limit the recommendation performance.
  To address these issues, we propose DiscRec, a novel framework that enables
Disentangled Semantic-Collaborative signal modeling with flexible fusion for
generative Recommendation.First, DiscRec introduces item-level position
embeddings, assigned based on indices within each semantic ID, enabling
explicit modeling of item structure in input token sequences.Second, DiscRec
employs a dual-branch module to disentangle the two signals at the embedding
layer: a semantic branch encodes semantic signals using original token
embeddings, while a collaborative branch applies localized attention restricted
to tokens within the same item to effectively capture collaborative signals. A
gating mechanism subsequently fuses both branches while preserving the model's
ability to model sequential dependencies. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets demonstrate that DiscRec effectively decouples these
signals and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our codes are
available on https://github.com/Ten-Mao/DiscRec.

The topics of symbolic benchmark synthesis, reasoning evaluation, and counterfactuals are not within the scope of the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

While it mentions user comments and feedback, the primary focus is on natural language processing and multimodal processing, which is not a central match for the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

#### Abstract
> Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

The topic of de-identification of court judgments is outside the scope of your interests and does not involve query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

While it touches on aspects of user behavior modeling, the context and application are quite different from the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

While it involves entity extraction and annotation, it does not directly relate to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.
