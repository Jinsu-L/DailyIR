        "abstract": "Access to diverse perspectives is essential for understanding real-world\nevents, yet most news retrieval systems prioritize textual relevance, leading\nto redundant results and limited viewpoint exposure. We propose NEWSCOPE, a\ntwo-stage framework for diverse news retrieval that enhances event coverage by\nexplicitly modeling semantic variation at the sentence level. The first stage\nretrieves topically relevant content using dense retrieval, while the second\nstage applies sentence-level clustering and diversity-aware re-ranking to\nsurface complementary information. To evaluate retrieval diversity, we\nintroduce three interpretable metrics, namely Average Pairwise Distance,\nPositive Cluster Coverage, and Information Density Ratio, and construct two\nparagraph-level benchmarks: LocalNews and DSGlobal. Experiments show that\nNEWSCOPE consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significantly\nhigher diversity without compromising relevance. Our results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of fine-grained, interpretable modeling in mitigating redundancy\nand promoting comprehensive event understanding.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a standard approach for\nimproving the reliability of large language models (LLMs). Prior work\ndemonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems by misleading them into\ngenerating attacker-chosen outputs through poisoning the knowledge base.\nHowever, this paper uncovers that such attacks could be mitigated by the strong\n\\textit{self-correction ability (SCA)} of modern LLMs, which can reject false\ncontext once properly configured. This SCA poses a significant challenge for\nattackers aiming to manipulate RAG systems.\n  In contrast to previous poisoning methods, which primarily target the\nknowledge base, we introduce \\textsc{DisarmRAG}, a new poisoning paradigm that\ncompromises the retriever itself to suppress the SCA and enforce\nattacker-chosen outputs. This compromisation enables the attacker to\nstraightforwardly embed anti-SCA instructions into the context provided to the\ngenerator, thereby bypassing the SCA. To this end, we present a\ncontrastive-learning-based model editing technique that performs localized and\nstealthy edits, ensuring the retriever returns a malicious instruction only for\nspecific victim queries while preserving benign retrieval behavior. To further\nstrengthen the attack, we design an iterative co-optimization framework that\nautomatically discovers robust instructions capable of bypassing prompt-based\ndefenses. We extensively evaluate DisarmRAG across six LLMs and three QA\nbenchmarks. Our results show near-perfect retrieval of malicious instructions,\nwhich successfully suppress SCA and achieve attack success rates exceeding 90\\%\nunder diverse defensive prompts. Also, the edited retriever remains stealthy\nunder several detection methods, highlighting the urgent need for\nretriever-centric defenses.",

        "abstract": "Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has effectively enhanced\nlarge language models in complex reasoning by organizing fragmented knowledge\ninto explicitly structured graphs. Prior efforts have been made to improve\neither graph construction or graph retrieval in isolation, yielding suboptimal\nperformance, especially when domain shifts occur. In this paper, we propose a\nvertically unified agentic paradigm, Youtu-GraphRAG, to jointly connect the\nentire framework as an intricate integration. Specifically, (i) a seed graph\nschema is introduced to bound the automatic extraction agent with targeted\nentity types, relations and attribute types, also continuously expanded for\nscalability over unseen domains; (ii) To obtain higher-level knowledge upon the\nschema, we develop novel dually-perceived community detection, fusing\nstructural topology with subgraph semantics for comprehensive knowledge\norganization. This naturally yields a hierarchical knowledge tree that supports\nboth top-down filtering and bottom-up reasoning with community summaries; (iii)\nAn agentic retriever is designed to interpret the same graph schema to\ntransform complex queries into tractable and parallel sub-queries. It\niteratively performs reflection for more advanced reasoning; (iv) To alleviate\nthe knowledge leaking problem in pre-trained LLM, we propose a tailored\nanonymous dataset and a novel 'Anonymity Reversion' task that deeply measures\nthe real performance of the GraphRAG frameworks. Extensive experiments across\nsix challenging benchmarks demonstrate the robustness of Youtu-GraphRAG,\nremarkably moving the Pareto frontier with up to 90.71% saving of token costs\nand 16.62% higher accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

For Task A, we jointly extract domain-specific terms and their\nontological types using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline.\nTraining data was reformulated into a document to terms and types\ncorrespondence, while test-time inference leverages semantically similar\ntraining examples. This single-pass method requires no model finetuning and\nimproves overall performance through lexical augmentation Task B, which\ninvolves assigning types to given terms, is handled via a dual strategy. In the\nfew-shot setting (for domains with labeled training data), we reuse the RAG\nscheme with few-shot prompting. In the zero-shot setting (for previously unseen\ndomains), we use a zero-shot classifier that combines cosine similarity scores\nfrom multiple embedding models using confidence-based weighting.

We introduce LaborBench, a question-and-answer\nbenchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI capabilities in this domain. We\nleverage a unique data source to create LaborBench: a dataset updated annually\nby teams of lawyers at the U.S. Department of Labor, who compile differences in\nunemployment insurance laws across 50 states for over 101 dimensions in a\nsix-month process, culminating in a 200-page publication of tables. Inspired by\nour collaboration with one U.S. state to explore using large language models\n(LLMs) to simplify codes in this domain, where complexity is particularly\nacute, we transform the DOL publication into LaborBench. This provides a unique\nbenchmark for AI capacity to conduct, distill, and extract realistic statutory\nand regulatory information. To assess the performance of retrieval augmented\ngeneration (RAG) approaches, we also compile StateCodes, a novel and\ncomprehensive state statute and regulatory corpus of 8.7 GB, enabling much more\nsystematic research into state codes.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an algorithm to select demonstration examples for\nin-context learning of a query set. Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we\nquickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream\ninference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and\nchain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context\nlearning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of\ntoken embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the\noutput taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs\nthrough a first-order approximation using the gradients. Then, we apply this\nestimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the\nsampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and\nselect $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing\nmodel outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative\nto model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models\nand datasets validate the efficiency of our approach. We show that the gradient\nestimation procedure yields approximations of full inference with less than\n$\\mathbf{1}\\%$ error across six datasets. This allows us to scale up subset\nselection that would otherwise run full inference by up to\n$\\mathbf{37.7}\\times$ on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, and\noutperform existing selection methods based on input embeddings by\n$\\mathbf{11}\\%$ on average.",

However, the evaluation for these methods relies on a single\nresponse and overlooks other potential outputs, which could also be generated\nin real-world applications within this hypothetical space. To address this\nissue, this paper presents a \\textbf{H}ypothesis-based\nPr\\textbf{E}ference-aware \\textbf{A}na\\textbf{L}ysis Framework (HEAL), a novel\nevaluation paradigm that formulates preference alignment as a re-ranking\nprocess within hypothesis spaces. The framework incorporates two complementary\nmetrics: ranking accuracy for evaluating ordinal consistency and preference\nstrength correlation for assessing continuous alignment. To facilitate this\nframework, we develop UniHypoBench, a unified hypothesis benchmark constructed\nfrom diverse instruction-response pairs. Through extensive experiments based on\nHEAL, with a particular focus on the intrinsic mechanisms of preference\nlearning, we demonstrate that current preference learning methods can\neffectively capture preferences provided by proxy models while simultaneously\nsuppressing negative samples. These findings contribute to preference learning\nresearch through two significant avenues. Theoretically, we introduce\nhypothesis space analysis as an innovative paradigm for understanding\npreference alignment.

        "abstract": "Centralized recommender systems encounter privacy leakage due to the need to\ncollect user behavior and other private data. Hence, federated recommender\nsystems (FedRec) have become a promising approach with an aggregated global\nmodel on the server. However, this distributed training paradigm suffers from\nembedding degradation caused by suboptimal personalization and dimensional\ncollapse, due to the existence of sparse interactions and heterogeneous\npreferences. To this end, we propose a novel model-agnostic strategy for FedRec\nto strengthen the personalized embedding utility, which is called Personalized\nLocal-Global Collaboration (PLGC). It is the first research in federated\nrecommendation to alleviate the dimensional collapse issue. Particularly, we\nincorporate the frozen global item embedding table into local devices. Based on\na Neural Tangent Kernel strategy that dynamically balances local and global\ninformation, PLGC optimizes personalized representations during forward\ninference, ultimately converging to user-specific preferences. Additionally,\nPLGC carries on a contrastive objective function to reduce embedding redundancy\nby dissolving dependencies between dimensions, thereby improving the backward\nrepresentation learning process. We introduce PLGC as a model-agnostic\npersonalized training strategy for federated recommendations that can be\napplied to existing baselines to alleviate embedding degradation. Extensive\nexperiments on five real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and\nadaptability of PLGC, which outperforms various baseline algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Extending recommender systems to federated learning (FL) frameworks to\nprotect the privacy of users or platforms while making recommendations has\nrecently gained widespread attention in academia. This is due to the natural\ncoupling of recommender systems and federated learning architectures: the data\noriginates from distributed clients (mostly mobile devices held by users),\nwhich are highly related to privacy. In a centralized recommender system\n(CenRec), the central server collects clients' data, trains the model, and\nprovides the service. Whereas in federated recommender systems (FedRec), the\nstep of data collecting is omitted, and the step of model training is offloaded\nto each client. The server only aggregates the model and other knowledge, thus\navoiding client privacy leakage. Some surveys of federated recommender systems\ndiscuss and analyze related work from the perspective of designing FL systems.\nHowever, their utility drops by ignoring specific recommendation scenarios'\nunique characteristics and practical challenges. For example, the statistical\nheterogeneity issue in cross-domain FedRec originates from the label drift of\nthe data held by different platforms, which is mainly caused by the recommender\nitself, but not the federated architecture. Therefore, it should focus more on\nsolving specific problems in real-world recommendation scenarios to encourage\nthe deployment FedRec. To this end, this review comprehensively analyzes the\ncoupling of recommender systems and federated learning from the perspective of\nrecommendation researchers and practitioners. We establish a clear link between\nrecommendation scenarios and FL frameworks, systematically analyzing\nscenario-specific approaches, practical challenges, and potential\nopportunities. We aim to develop guidance for the real-world deployment of\nFedRec, bridging the gap between existing research and applications.",

Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in\npractice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how\nLLMs integrate external knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on\nnoise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within\nthe LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate\nlayers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper\nlayers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this\ninsight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that\ndirectly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer\ndecoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge. To identify\nthe optimal intermediate layer, we introduce an internal knowledge score (IKS)\ncriterion that selects the layer with the lowest IKS value in the latter half\nof layers. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LFD\nhelps RAG systems more effectively surface retrieved context knowledge with\nminimal cost.",

We propose a novel data synthesis\nframework called Functionality-Oriented Code Self-Evolution to construct\ndiverse and challenging benchmarks. Specifically, we define code examples\nacross four semantic and syntactic categories and find that existing datasets\npredominantly capture syntactic properties. Our framework generates four unique\nvariations from a single code instance, providing a broader spectrum of code\nexamples that better reflect functional differences. Extensive experiments on\nthree downstream tasks-code clone detection, code functional consistency\nidentification, and code retrieval-demonstrate that embedding models\nsignificantly improve their performance when trained on our evolved datasets.\nThese results highlight the effectiveness and generalization of our data\nsynthesis framework, advancing the functional understanding of code.",

        "title": "A Hybrid Recommendation Framework for Enhancing User Engagement in Local News",
        "abstract": "Local news organizations face an urgent need to boost reader engagement amid\ndeclining circulation and competition from global media. Personalized news\nrecommender systems offer a promising solution by tailoring content to user\ninterests. Yet, conventional approaches often emphasize general preferences and\nmay overlook nuanced or eclectic interests in local news.\n  We propose a hybrid news recommender that integrates local and global\npreference models to improve engagement. Building on evidence of the value of\nlocalized models, our method unifies local and non-local predictors in one\nframework. The system adaptively combines recommendations from a local model,\nspecialized in region-specific content, and a global model that captures\nbroader preferences. Ensemble strategies and multiphase training balance the\ntwo.\n  We evaluated the model on two datasets: a synthetic set based on Syracuse\nnewspaper distributions and a Danish dataset (EB-NeRD) labeled for local and\nnon-local content with an LLM. Results show our integrated approach outperforms\nsingle-model baselines in accuracy and coverage, suggesting improved\npersonalization that can drive user engagement.\n  The findings have practical implications for publishers, especially local\noutlets. By leveraging both community-specific and general user interests, the\nhybrid recommender can deliver more relevant content, increasing retention and\nsubscriptions. In sum, this work introduces a new direction for recommender\nsystems, bridging local and global models to revitalize local news consumption\nthrough scalable, personalized user experiences.",

Despite its broadness, most existing research on computational\nhumor traditionally focused on modeling a specific type of humor.

This question is especially timely as new humor types\ncontinuously emerge in online and social media contexts (e.g., memes,\nanti-humor, AI fails). If Large Language Models (LLMs) are to keep up with this\nevolving landscape, they must be able to generalize across humor types by\ncapturing deeper, transferable mechanisms. To investigate this, we conduct a\nseries of transfer learning experiments across four datasets, representing\ndifferent humor tasks. We train LLMs under varied diversity settings (1-3\ndatasets in training, testing on a novel task). Experiments reveal that models\nare capable of some transfer, and can reach up to 75% accuracy on unseen\ndatasets; training on diverse sources improves transferability (1.88-4.05%)\nwith minimal-to-no drop in in-domain performance.

        "abstract": "Legal text classification is a fundamental NLP task in the legal domain.\nBenchmark datasets in this area often exhibit a long-tail label distribution,\nwhere many labels are underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on\nrare classes. This paper proposes Selective Retrieval-Augmentation (SRA) as a\nsolution to this problem. SRA focuses on augmenting samples belonging to\nlow-frequency labels in the training set, preventing the introduction of noise\nfor well-represented classes, and requires no changes to the model\narchitecture. Retrieval is performed only from the training data to ensure\nthere is no potential information leakage, removing the need for external\ncorpora simultaneously. The proposed SRA method is tested on two legal text\nclassification benchmark datasets with long-tail distributions: LEDGAR\n(single-label) and UNFAIR-ToS (multi-label). The results indicate that SRA\nattains higher micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores compared to all current LexGLUE\nbaselines across both datasets, illustrating consistent improvements in\nlong-tail legal text classification.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved high accuracy on complex\ncommonsense and mathematical problems that involve the composition of multiple\nreasoning steps. However, current compositional benchmarks testing these skills\ntend to focus on either commonsense or math reasoning, whereas LLM agents\nsolving real-world tasks would require a combination of both. In this work, we\nintroduce an Agentic Commonsense and Math benchmark (AgentCoMa), where each\ncompositional task requires a commonsense reasoning step and a math reasoning\nstep. We test it on 61 LLMs of different sizes, model families, and training\nstrategies. We find that LLMs can usually solve both steps in isolation, yet\ntheir accuracy drops by ~30% on average when the two are combined. This is a\nsubstantially greater performance gap than the one we observe in prior\ncompositional benchmarks that combine multiple steps of the same reasoning\ntype. In contrast, non-expert human annotators can solve the compositional\nquestions and the individual steps in AgentCoMa with similarly high accuracy.\nFurthermore, we conduct a series of interpretability studies to better\nunderstand the performance gap, examining neuron patterns, attention maps and\nmembership inference. Our work underscores a substantial degree of model\nbrittleness in the context of mixed-type compositional reasoning and offers a\ntest bed for future improvement.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to\nautoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible\ntoken orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of\nautoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and\nthe large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It\nintegrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible\noverhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of\nLLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the\nnumber of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation\nquality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop\nsampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet\npowerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing\nspeedup techniques.

We present a set of Outcome\nReward Models (ORMs) for deductive reasoning.

In particular, we propose an echo\ngeneration technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect\nassumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering\npreviously unexplored error types. While a standard CoT chain may contain\nerrors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers\nthe model toward incorrect reasoning.

As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional\nfinetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and\ngeneralised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA. Our\nfindings expose when LLM-based commonsense knowledge beats retrieval from\ncommonsense knowledge bases, how noise-aware training stabilises small models\nin the context of external knowledge augmentation, and why parameter-efficient\ncommonsense reasoning is now within reach for 250M models.",

Previous detection\nmethods, including fine-tuned small models or LLM-based detectors, often\nstruggle with its dynamically evolving nature. In this work, we propose a novel\nframework called the Symbolic Adversarial Learning Framework (SALF), which\nimplements an adversarial training paradigm by an agent symbolic learning\noptimization process, rather than relying on numerical updates. SALF introduces\na paradigm where the generation agent crafts deceptive narratives, and the\ndetection agent uses structured debates to identify logical and factual flaws\nfor detection, and they iteratively refine themselves through such adversarial\ninteractions. Unlike traditional neural updates, we represent agents using\nagent symbolic learning, where learnable weights are defined by agent prompts,\nand simulate back-propagation and gradient descent by operating on natural\nlanguage representations of weights, loss, and gradients. Experiments on two\nmultilingual benchmark datasets demonstrate SALF's effectiveness, showing it\ngenerates sophisticated fake news that degrades state-of-the-art detection\nperformance by up to 53.4% in Chinese and 34.2% in English on average.

Second,\nloopholes pose an interesting and novel alignment problem where the model is\npresented with conflicting goals and can exploit ambiguities to its own\nadvantage. To address these questions, we design scenarios where LLMs are given\na goal and an ambiguous user instruction in conflict with the goal, with\nscenarios covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power\ndynamics. We then measure different models' abilities to exploit loopholes to\nsatisfy their given goals as opposed to the goals of the user.

This study investigates\ngeopolitical parallax-systematic divergence in news quality and subjectivity\nassessments-by comparing article-level embeddings from Chinese-origin (Qwen,\nBGE, Jina) and Western-origin (Snowflake, Granite) model families. We evaluate\nboth on a human-annotated news quality benchmark spanning fifteen stylistic,\ninformational, and affective dimensions, and on parallel corpora covering\npolitically sensitive topics, including Palestine and reciprocal China-United\nStates coverage. Using logistic regression probes and matched-topic evaluation,\nwe quantify per-metric differences in predicted positive-class probabilities\nbetween model families. Our findings reveal consistent, non-random divergences\naligned with model origin. In Palestine-related coverage, Western models assign\nhigher subjectivity and positive emotion scores, while Chinese models emphasize\nnovelty and descriptiveness. Cross-topic analysis shows asymmetries in\nstructural quality metrics Chinese-on-US scoring notably lower in fluency,\nconciseness, technicality, and overall quality-contrasted by higher negative\nemotion scores. These patterns align with media bias theory and our distinction\nbetween semantic, emotional, and relational subjectivity, and extend LLM bias\nliterature by showing that geopolitical framing effects persist in downstream\nquality assessment tasks. We conclude that LLM-based media evaluation pipelines\nrequire cultural calibration to avoid conflating content differences with\nmodel-induced bias.",

        "llm_reason": "The paper focuses on text embeddings and few-shot classification for survey responses, which is related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data mining. However, it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest in Information Retrieval (IR). The paper's relevance is somewhat limited due to its focus on qualitative analysis and survey responses, which is not directly applicable to search technologies."
