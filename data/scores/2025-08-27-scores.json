        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in document\nre-ranking, a key component in modern Information Retrieval (IR) systems.\nHowever, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations, including\nranking uncertainty, unstable top-k recovery, and high token cost due to\ntoken-intensive prompting. To effectively address these limitations, we propose\nREALM, an uncertainty-aware re-ranking framework that models LLM-derived\nrelevance as Gaussian distributions and refines them through recursive Bayesian\nupdates. By explicitly capturing uncertainty and minimizing redundant queries,\nREALM achieves better rankings more efficiently. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our REALM surpasses state-of-the-art re-rankers while\nsignificantly reducing token usage and latency, promoting it as the\nnext-generation re-ranker for modern IR systems.",

        "abstract": "Vector similarity search plays a pivotal role in modern information retrieval\nsystems, especially when powered by transformer-based embeddings. However, the\nscalability and efficiency of such systems are often hindered by the high\ndimensionality of latent representations. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngame-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression to enhance\nboth the efficiency and semantic utility of vector search. By modeling the\ncompression strategy as a zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage\nefficiency, we derive a latent transformation that preserves semantic\nsimilarity while reducing redundancy. We benchmark our method against FAISS, a\nwidely-used vector search library, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a\nsignificantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873\nvs. 0.5194), albeit with a modest increase in query time. This trade-off\nhighlights the practical value of game-theoretic latent compression in\nhigh-utility, transformer-based search applications. The proposed system can be\nseamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines to yield more semantically\naccurate and computationally efficient retrieval.",

However, most systems remain constrained by a linear\nrequest-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in\nmulti-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm\nin which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces\n(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework\nleverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative\nrefinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic\nevaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares\ngenerative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,\ninteraction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and\nemotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces\nconsistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in\nover 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative\ninterfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely deployed in\nreal-world applications in diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, and\ncybersecurity. However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to\nknowledge corruption attacks, where an attacker can inject adversarial texts\ninto the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate\nattacker-desired outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific\nqueries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose\nUniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike\nprior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that\ncan simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics\nand domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such\nas directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution,\nor launching denial-of-service attacks. We formulate UniC-RAG as an\noptimization problem and further design an effective solution to solve it,\nincluding a balanced similarity-based clustering method to enhance the attack's\neffectiveness. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly\neffective and significantly outperforms baselines. For instance, UniC-RAG could\nachieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a\nknowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set\nof user queries (e.g., 2,000). Additionally, we evaluate existing defenses and\nshow that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the\nneed for new defense mechanisms in RAG systems.",

However, current\nLLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously\nmaintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that\nhumans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack\nsupport from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear\noverly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to\nbreak the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose\nCollaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates\noutput probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This\nintegration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling\nthe selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's\ninternal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking\nmechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while\nensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through\ncomprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates\nsuperior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising\nexpressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its\neffectiveness and generalizability.",

        "abstract": "Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep\nthinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has\nprimarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely\noverlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors\nremains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of\nmanual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options\nSynthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual\noptions. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning\nprocess and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically\nplausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a\ndiscrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.\nExperimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in\ncontent discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over\nexisting methods across various subjects and educational levels.",

However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of\nthese systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on\nwhether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting\nsensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have\nprimarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention\nhas been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,\ndespite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic\nQA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy\npreservation.

Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity\nand achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets.

Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user\nengagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains\na significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of\nLLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods\nexhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic\nunderstanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,\nabstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises\nquestions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we\nanalyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the\nre-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more\ninformed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs\nand limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize\na relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science\ndomain to re-rank retrieved content.

        "title": "Emotion Omni: Enabling Empathetic Speech Response Generation through Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can\nnow interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models\nsimply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the\nrich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many\ncases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional\nexpression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving\nuser experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with\nempathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires\nvast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key\nchallenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic\nresponses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To\naddress this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture\ndesigned to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate\nempathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation\npipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional\ndialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech\nassistant.

Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing\nquality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint\nfollowing (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement\nlearning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward\nstrategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight\nmixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.\nTo address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards\n(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model\nevaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model\nassessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward\nweight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled\ngroups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in\nGRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this\nproposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse\nmodel families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a\nreal-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.\nResults illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both\ninstruction following (IFEval from 83.36\\% to 86.65\\%) and writing quality\n(72.75\\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the\nbest of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences\nwith objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective\nsolution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.",

However, we reveal that\ncurrent Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility\nin Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly\nwhen faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We\nattribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical\nconcepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in\ntraining data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.\nTo address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original\nVQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,\nsentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming\nperformance drops (e.g., a 40\\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA\nbenchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose\nConsistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key\ncomponents: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with\nmedical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware\ncontrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative\nrepresentation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA\nbenchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\\% on the challenging\nRoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness.

        "abstract": "The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has\nalso brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.\nGuardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'\ninput/output text through various detectors. However, developing and\nmaintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the\ndifficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs\nprior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet\nintuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice\nguardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a\nsparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our\naim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original\ndataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with\nour synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We\ntest our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the\nidentification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement\nversus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to\n3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.",

As a result, research methods that enable\nsense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the\nburden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.\n  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous\nanalysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted\ncontent analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of\nlarge language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research\nwhich they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education\ndataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous\nmanner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more\ngeneralisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the\ndevelopment of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and\nresearch quality of the CER discipline.",

Despite\ntheir practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD\nevaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world\ndeployment.\n  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained\nfrom OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in\nexisting question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious\nfeatures or prediction shortcuts.\n  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an\nestimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different\nquality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution\nevaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious\nshortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a\ndataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected.
