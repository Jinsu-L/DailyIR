        "title": "LLMs as Sparse Retrievers:A Framework for First-Stage Product Search",
        "abstract": "Product search is a crucial component of modern e-commerce platforms, with\nbillions of user queries every day. In product search systems, first-stage\nretrieval should achieve high recall while ensuring efficient online\ndeployment. Sparse retrieval is particularly attractive in this context due to\nits interpretability and storage efficiency. However, sparse retrieval methods\nsuffer from severe vocabulary mismatch issues, leading to suboptimal\nperformance in product search scenarios. With their potential for semantic\nanalysis, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for mitigating\nvocabulary mismatch issues and thereby improving retrieval quality. Directly\napplying LLMs to sparse retrieval in product search exposes two key\nchallenges:(1)Queries and product titles are typically short and highly\nsusceptible to LLM-induced hallucinations, such as generating irrelevant\nexpansion terms or underweighting critical literal terms like brand names and\nmodel numbers;(2)The large vocabulary space of LLMs leads to difficulty in\ninitializing training effectively, making it challenging to learn meaningful\nsparse representations in such ultra-high-dimensional spaces.To address these\nchallenges, we propose PROSPER, a framework for PROduct search leveraging LLMs\nas SParsE Retrievers. PROSPER incorporates: (1)A literal residual network that\nalleviates hallucination in lexical expansion by reinforcing underweighted\nliteral terms through a residual compensation mechanism; and (2)A lexical\nfocusing window that facilitates effective training initialization via a\ncoarse-to-fine sparsification strategy.Extensive offline and online experiments\nshow that PROSPER significantly outperforms sparse baselines and achieves\nrecall performance comparable to advanced dense retrievers, while also\nachieving revenue increments online.",

This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a\nvoice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for\nBengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural\nhandbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the\ncontent; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic\nretrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can call the system\nto receive real-time, context-aware advice: speech-to-text converts the Bengali\nquery, the RAG module retrieves relevant content, a large language model (Gemma\n3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers the\nanswer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced\nhigh-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop\nmanagement, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the\nKisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on\na 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual\nrichness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable\nrelevance and technical specificity. Semantic similarity analysis further\nrevealed a strong correlation between retrieved context and answer quality,\nemphasizing the importance of grounding generative responses in curated\ndocumentation. KrishokBondhu demonstrates the feasibility of integrating\ncall-centre accessibility, multilingual voice interaction, and modern RAG\ntechniques to deliver expert-level agricultural guidance to remote Bangladeshi\nfarmers, paving the way toward a fully AI-driven agricultural advisory\necosystem.",

        "abstract": "Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons\nare arranged topographically according to their response properties, at\nmultiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning\nmodels lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces\nthat are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of\nself-attention that turns Transformers into \"Topoformers\" with topographic\norganization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are\narranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given\nkey - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected\nlayer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate\nthe feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment\nclassification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic\norganization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately\nencourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs.\nWe then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with\na masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant\nperforms on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet\nproduces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight\nlinguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain\nresponses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment\nbetween low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and\nhuman brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for\ngreater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the\norganization of linguistic information in the human brain.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity remains a persistent public health emergency in the United\nStates, tightly interwoven with chronic disease, mental illness, and opioid\nmisuse. Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries,\naccess remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static\ndirectories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and\ngeographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague\nnutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as\ntime, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems\noptimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of\nfood-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified\navailability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most\nvulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital\nilliteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we\nintroduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for\nreal-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three\ninnovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases,\ncommunity platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of\nfood resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on\ncurated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional\ncorrectness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval\npolicies to evolving user needs. By bridging information acquisition, semantic\nanalysis, and decision support, Food4All delivers nutritionally annotated and\nguidance at the point of need. This framework establishes an urgent step toward\nscalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations\nfacing food insecurity and its compounding health risks.",

        "abstract": "The adoption of long context windows has become a standard feature in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), as extended contexts significantly enhance their\ncapacity for complex reasoning and broaden their applicability across diverse\nscenarios. Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the\ncomputational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with\ndynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed\nsettings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and\nstep-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed\nmethodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training\nfor LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key\ncomponents: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention,\nand hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to\nsynergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads\ninherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models\nwith extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by\ntraining Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K\ntokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite\nof downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A\nHaystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput\nwhile preserving model accuracy.

Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless\ninteractions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and\nutilization mechanisms.

To this end, we introduce a new\nmemory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance\nand efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of\nhuman memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,\ncognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information\nthrough lightweight compression and groups information according to their\ntopics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based\ngroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,\nlong-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that\ndecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with\nGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in\naccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API\ncalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

        "abstract": "Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent\ntransportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly\nreleased models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong\nvisual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance\nwithout costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates\nvision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to\nsupport zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts\nvehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a\ndatabase of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with\nthe description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and\nmodel. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by\nadding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed\nmethod improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating\nthe potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city\napplications.",

        "abstract": "Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) remains a long-standing\nchallenge in NLP, where models must learn from noisy bag-level annotations\nwhile making sentence-level predictions. While existing state-of-the-art (SoTA)\nDSRE models rely on task-specific training, their integration with in-context\nlearning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. A key\nchallenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to\nnoisy annotation.\n  In response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation\nExtraction framework. It first uses a trained DSRE model to identify the top-k\ncandidate relations for a given test sentence, then uses a novel dynamic\nexemplar retrieval strategy that extracts reliable, sentence-level exemplars\nfrom training data, which are then provided in LLM prompt for outputting the\nfinal relation(s).\n  We further extend HYDRE to cross-lingual settings for RE in low-resource\nlanguages.

        "title": "From Retrieval to Generation: Unifying External and Parametric Knowledge for Medical Question Answering",
        "abstract": "Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific\nknowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs)\nwith external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge\nstored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two\ncategories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning\non externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG),\nwhich depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual\ndocuments. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while\nGAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to\nunconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine\nanswer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified\nretrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external\nand parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules:\nKnowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to\nproduce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by\nretrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively\nselects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form\nconcise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments\non five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5%\nimprovement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the\neffectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive\nreasoning.

        "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth\nuniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise\nprediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models.",

While\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the\nnuances of personalization.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust\nreinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable\npersonalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a\nPersonalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional\nscores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a\nCritique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs\nbased on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning.

Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an\naverage 11\\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses\nthe performance of GPT-4.1.

        "abstract": "Recommender-systems research has accelerated model and evaluation advances,\nyet largely neglects automating the research process itself. We argue for a\nshift from narrow AutoRecSys tools -- focused on algorithm selection and\nhyper-parameter tuning -- to an Autonomous Recommender-Systems Research Lab\n(AutoRecLab) that integrates end-to-end automation: problem ideation,\nliterature analysis, experimental design and execution, result interpretation,\nmanuscript drafting, and provenance logging. Drawing on recent progress in\nautomated science (e.g., multi-agent AI Scientist and AI Co-Scientist systems),\nwe outline an agenda for the RecSys community: (1) build open AutoRecLab\nprototypes that combine LLM-driven ideation and reporting with automated\nexperimentation; (2) establish benchmarks and competitions that evaluate agents\non producing reproducible RecSys findings with minimal human input; (3) create\nreview venues for transparently AI-generated submissions; (4) define standards\nfor attribution and reproducibility via detailed research logs and metadata;\nand (5) foster interdisciplinary dialogue on ethics, governance, privacy, and\nfairness in autonomous research. Advancing this agenda can increase research\nthroughput, surface non-obvious insights, and position RecSys to contribute to\nemerging Artificial Research Intelligence. We conclude with a call to organise\na community retreat to coordinate next steps and co-author guidance for the\nresponsible integration of automated research systems.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing latent semantics and\ncontextual relationships across diverse modalities. However, in modeling user\nbehavior from sequential interaction data, performance often suffers when such\nsemantic context is limited or absent. We introduce LaMAR, a LLM-driven\nsemantic enrichment framework designed to enrich such sequences automatically.\nLaMAR leverages LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate auxiliary contextual\nsignals by inferring latent semantic aspects of a user's intent and item\nrelationships from existing metadata. These generated signals, such as inferred\nusage scenarios, item intents, or thematic summaries, augment the original\nsequences with greater contextual depth. We demonstrate the utility of this\ngenerated resource by integrating it into benchmark sequential modeling tasks,\nwhere it consistently improves performance. Further analysis shows that\nLLM-generated signals exhibit high semantic novelty and diversity, enhancing\nthe representational capacity of the downstream models. This work represents a\nnew data-centric paradigm where LLMs serve as intelligent context generators,\ncontributing a new method for the semi-automatic creation of training data and\nlanguage resources.",

        "title": "SimBA: Simplifying Benchmark Analysis Using Performance Matrices Alone",
        "abstract": "Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult\nto make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation\nnumbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase\nframework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk,\nwhere we conduct dataset & model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a\nrepresentative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to\npredict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three\npopular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all\nthree benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk).\nWe develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark\nusing raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25%\n(1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and\nBigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl).\nAdditionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve\nmodel ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero\nmean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers\nimprove efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether\ntheir newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark.

        "abstract": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic\nunderstanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,\nrequiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object\ninter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,\nprevious attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in\nisolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce\nGrasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.\nEmpowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports\n(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)\nmodeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally\nachieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form\nquestions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to\nactive dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a\nmore accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more\nimportantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple\nregions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains\nthe state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5\non DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple\nprompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B\non GAR-Bench-VQA.

While\neffective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource\nlanguages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating\ncomputation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move\ntoward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images\n(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,\nreusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale\nmultimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or\nsurpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and\nreducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,\nrobustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy.

Our approach employs a\ncompetence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty\n(in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting\nreliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system,\nRLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention,\nreducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC\nbenchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to\n75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%).

        "title": "Adapting Language Balance in Code-Switching Speech",
        "abstract": "Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large\nfoundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data\nscarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the\nreason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the\nembedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the\nmodels to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to\nprovide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on\ncode-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points\nwhere recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis\nemphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,\nwe leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to\nhighlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those\nlocations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context\nbias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby\nimproving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and\nChinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places\nmore correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.",

The evolving distribution provides additional contextual grounding\nfor the policy, enabling adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty.\nPreliminary experiments in the SOTOPIA environment show consistent\nimprovements: the proposed framework increases the Overall score by 9.0% on\nSOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared with the Qwen2.5-7B baseline, and\nslightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions.\nThese early results suggest that probabilistic intent modeling can contribute\nto the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.",

        "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from\nvast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on\ntextual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by\nformal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from\nexecuting test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is\ninefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual\nrepresentation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle\nlogical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel\napproach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training\npipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level\nexecution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution\nsemantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using\nexisting on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL\nalgorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms\npost-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6%\naverage relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to\nother coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning\nand test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong\napplicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe\nanalyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment\nbetween code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics.",

While promising, transformers' computational cost\nscales quadratically with the user sequence length and linearly with the number\nof candidates. This trade-off makes it prohibitively expensive to expand\ncandidate sets or increase sequence length at inference, despite the\nsignificant performance improvements.\n  We introduce \\textbf{LIME}, a novel architecture that resolves this\ntrade-off. Through two key innovations, LIME fundamentally reduces\ncomputational complexity. First, low-rank ``link embeddings\" enable\npre-computation of attention weights by decoupling user and candidate\ninteractions, making the inference cost nearly independent of candidate set\nsize. Second, a linear attention mechanism, \\textbf{LIME-XOR}, reduces the\ncomplexity with respect to user sequence length from quadratic ($O(N^2)$) to\nlinear ($O(N)$).\n  Experiments on public and industrial datasets show LIME achieves near-parity\nwith state-of-the-art transformers but with a 10$\\times$ inference speedup on\nlarge candidate sets or long sequence lengths.

We observed that accelerating the\ncode generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads\nto a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce\nefficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced\nRemasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to\nachieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.\nSpecifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation\nprocess: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is\nestablished; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated\ntokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks\nshow that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over\nmainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%\ninference speedup.

Ring-1T delivers\nbreakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on\nHMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a\nsilver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional\nreasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the\ncommunity, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge\nreasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in\ndemocratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline\nfor open-source model performance.",
