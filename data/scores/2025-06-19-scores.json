        "abstract": "Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it\ndemands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse\nexpressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial\nand challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to\ncapture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses\nand reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as\npairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive\ninterpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some\ndescriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most\nnotably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and\nnon-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose\n\\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes\nopen-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different\nevaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point\nscoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware\nlistwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,\nincluding self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community\nresources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers\nmore interpretable results.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet\ntheir performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags\ndue to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge\nis achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like\ntranslation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces\nTargeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.\nWe first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits\nstrong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its\nearly internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine\nsimilarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its\nfinal output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).\nTLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a\ncontrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting\nembeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our\nexperiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical\nalignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine\nsimilarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More\nimportantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control\nword pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17\nx 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve\nand propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a\nparameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in\nLRL-focused LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for\nlarge language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with\ncitation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently\nfail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,\nciting incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we\nexplore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance\ngrounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method\nto train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer\ncorrectness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold\nreasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments\nacross ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented\nmodels significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in\nhandling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage\ntraining setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,\nfurther improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we\nrevisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it\nwith GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our\nfindings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and\noutcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.",

However,\ncurrent frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,\ncross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task\ncomplexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a\nnovel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)\na divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries\ninto hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and\ndistributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that\ndynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based\non task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies\ncombining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance\nacross diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best\nbaseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME\n(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance\nadvantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,\nparticularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage\npoints compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

However, modern\nrecommendation systems still struggle to address item cold-start challenges due\nto the heavy reliance on item and historical interactions, which are\nnon-trivial for cold-start items lacking sufficient exposure and feedback.\nLookalike algorithms provide a promising solution by extending feedback for new\nitems based on lookalike users. Traditional lookalike algorithms face such\nlimitations: (1) failing to effectively model the lookalike users and further\nimprove recommendations with the existing rule- or model-based methods; and (2)\nstruggling to utilize the interaction signals and incorporate diverse features\nin modern recommendation systems.\n  Inspired by lookalike algorithms, we propose Next-User Retrieval, a novel\nframework for enhancing cold-start recommendations via generative next-user\nmodeling.

        "abstract": "Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely\ndriven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New\nevaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities\nof LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)\nreasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling\nlonger-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model\nbehavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically\nchallenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long\ninputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs\non the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a\nnovel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently\ngenerate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)\nexamples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,\nmodifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning\nchallenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text\nsurface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We\nanalyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that\nMDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively\nshort document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)\nallows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning\ncapabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and\nfuture modeling improvements.",

However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,\nparticularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their\nsubstantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling\nknowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key\nchallenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built\non different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,\ntoken splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation\nto a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a\nnovel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a\nRecalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between\nheterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different\ntypes of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline\nperformances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source\nVLMs.",

To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite\nobjective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem\ndecomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that\nreinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.\nOptimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns\nacross all cohort members.

        "abstract": "Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on\nmanual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for\nextracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based\nrewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning\nmodel to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the\nreasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified\nrule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers\nto compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as\nan auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy\noptimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\\%\nrelative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a\n6.1\\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,\ncompared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but\nwithout the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the\nextracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that\nAutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model\nwhen run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted\nrules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets.

To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following\nabilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether\nconcepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous\nevaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36\nLLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of\ninstructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to\nlow-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is\naltered.

Current approaches typically\nmerge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing\nphenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and\ndegraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new\ntask, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our\ndataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised\nmulti-sentence caption-graph pairs for images.

While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS\nimproves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,\nhigh inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and\nsmaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs.

To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding\nSupervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained\nwith relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only\nover the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both\ntextual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In\nthe text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11\ninformation-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding\ntechniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's\nLLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four\nbenchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.\nThis improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream\nperformance.

These\nprototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly\ndiverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this\nhypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning\nability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical\nrepresentations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for\nplanning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction\npipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;\n(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through\nProlog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems\narbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive\nexperiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline\nmodels on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning\ntasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics\n(AIME24).

However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety\nconcerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite\nsubstantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models\ncan still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -\neven when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we\nempirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of\nsafety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building\non this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank\nExtrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety\nsubspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness\nof LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both\nbenign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's\nadaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute\nreductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning\nattacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the\nsuccess of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter\nzone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

However, current methods face two key challenges: token-item\nmisalignment, where uniform token-level modeling ignores item-level granularity\nthat is critical for collaborative signal learning, and semantic-collaborative\nsignal entanglement, where collaborative and semantic signals exhibit distinct\ndistributions yet are fused in a unified embedding space, leading to\nconflicting optimization objectives that limit the recommendation performance.\n  To address these issues, we propose DiscRec, a novel framework that enables\nDisentangled Semantic-Collaborative signal modeling with flexible fusion for\ngenerative Recommendation.First, DiscRec introduces item-level position\nembeddings, assigned based on indices within each semantic ID, enabling\nexplicit modeling of item structure in input token sequences.Second, DiscRec\nemploys a dual-branch module to disentangle the two signals at the embedding\nlayer: a semantic branch encodes semantic signals using original token\nembeddings, while a collaborative branch applies localized attention restricted\nto tokens within the same item to effectively capture collaborative signals. A\ngating mechanism subsequently fuses both branches while preserving the model's\nability to model sequential dependencies. Extensive experiments on four\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that DiscRec effectively decouples these\nsignals and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature\ndescriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors\nencoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe\nIdentification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the\ninherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that\nassign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced\ndescriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to\nlanguage models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,\ndemonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature\ndescriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description\nscore) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is\npresent (via a polysemanticity score).",

        "title": "Thunder-DeID: Accurate and Efficient De-identification Framework for Korean Court Judgments",
        "abstract": "To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data\nprotection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court\njudgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current\nde-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale\nwhile adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal\ndefinitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not\nwell-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nde-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant\nlaws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean\nlegal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of\nentity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally\nIdentifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural\nnetwork (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the\nde-identification of court judgments.",

        "abstract": "Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate\ndescriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In\nthis paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language\nmodel (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with\npaired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We\npropose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video\ndescriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we\npropose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically\nupdating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module\nas a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and\nincorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the\nprocess. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances\nvideo-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by\n28\\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,\nsurpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning\ntasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art\non widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar\nsize.

        "abstract": "As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the\nnumber of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.\nPipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing\ntechniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational\nlinguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the\ndeeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic\nnarratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.\nInstead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and\nNew York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous\nnarrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives\nproduced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of\nextracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls\nshort of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and\nnarratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide\nguidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs\nto pursue similar objectives.",

We applied this\nframework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in\nvarious public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating\nthe tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)\nfor contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this\nlanguage model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new\npractices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of\nhuman subjects.",

The dataset includes 14 clinically\nsignificant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along\nwith contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital\noccurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and\noverlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We\nevaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:\nfine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While\ntransformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on\ndocument-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops\nnotably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly\nfor rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite\nhigh-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented\nAEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted\nResearch Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch\nand serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and\nsupporting future cross-dataset generalisation.",
