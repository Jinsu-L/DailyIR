        "title": "Generalized Pseudo-Relevance Feedback",
        "abstract": "Query rewriting is a fundamental technique in information retrieval (IR). It\ntypically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the\nquery and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and\nrelevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its\nvector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging\ntop-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed\nbased on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are\nrelevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed\nspecifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language\nmodels (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free\nquery reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again,\nrelies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting\nquality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed\nframework: \\textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which\nperforms model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents,\nnot only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the\nrelevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training\npipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy\nfeedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers\ndemonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing\nit as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.",

        "abstract": "In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in\nmodeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring\noptimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent\nresearch follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator\nproduces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In\npractice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.\nHowever, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the\nseparation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,\nautoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we\npropose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address\nthe two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an\nautoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic\nautoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we\npre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter\ninitialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating\nsequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we\npropose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient\nautoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),\nwhich trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items\nwhile preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time\nrecommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF\noutperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is\nnearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also\nbeen deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily\nactive users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.",

        "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural\nLanguage Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains\nlike religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination\nand unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly\ncritical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and\ntrustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nsystems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,\nmulti-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To\naddress this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful\nAdvanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built\nupon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative\nRefinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting\nprocess: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence\nsufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,\nprogressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base\nof over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates\nsuperior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA\nbenchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable\n97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a\nhigh Answer Correctness score of 74.3%.

However, existing\nlanguage agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks\nthat lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to\nevaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the\nTool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering\ndiverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable\nexecution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604\ntools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to\nprofessional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools\nare based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we\nmay have revised or implemented ourselves.

        "abstract": "ZK-SenseLM is a secure and auditable wireless sensing framework that pairs a\nlarge-model encoder for Wi-Fi channel state information (and optionally mmWave\nradar or RFID) with a policy-grounded decision layer and end-to-end\nzero-knowledge proofs of inference. The encoder uses masked spectral\npretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal\nalignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens.\nTo reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated\nselective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is\nregistered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving\npipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version\nbinding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the\nquantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and\nconfidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a\ngateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates\nwith differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization\nwithout weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are\npart of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion,\nrespiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1\nand calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and\nrejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification.",

However,\nexisting paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,\nfailing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This\nsequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal\nperformance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent\nPlanning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task\ndependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and\nserial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose\ncomplex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining\nwhich tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential\ndependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial\nimprovements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we\nconstruct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from\nthe Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage\ntraining strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,\nfollowed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward\nfunction on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides\nmaximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP\nsignificantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on\nmulti-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool\ninvocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

We propose\nTime-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a\nmodel inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters\ncapture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing\nboth fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec\nachieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction\npatterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for\nself-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.\nExtensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.",

Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not\ninherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that\nMDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP\nframework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.",

PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current\nadapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance\nadaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.\nTheoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,\ndirection-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace.

Recent work improves KBQA by\nadopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)\niteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,\nand interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically\nfine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,\nwhich offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the\nagentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that\ncan autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To\nincentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under\noutcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning\nwith an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic\ncapabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of\nhigh-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.\nThen, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it\napplies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy\nto hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful\nreasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three\nmainstream datasets.

We first empirically demonstrate that a wide\nrange of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,\nmatrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and\nresponses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure\ncan be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to\na target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,\nor even nonsensical prompts.\n  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of\nlanguage models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal\nabstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then\nanalyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning\nguarantees.",

Current paradigms either myopically\noptimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,\ncreating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce\n\\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and\ndeploying proactive dialogue agents \\textit{directly from offline expert data},\nbypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to\nreframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \\textbf{observed\nfuture} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,\nturn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,\ndecomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised\nlearning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action,\nstate_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,\n\\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader\nCalibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward\nmodel with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy\nof \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying\nsizes up to 32B.

We therefore assume\ncitation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency\nwith which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the\npretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated\nreferences in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified\n100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured\nfactual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic\nmetadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across\nresearch domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual\naccuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly\nmemorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations.

        "abstract": "Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics\ntreat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional\nstructure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),\na semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting\nmultidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)\ndefined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a\ntransformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP\nprojection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between\ndiscourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between\ncorresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that\nquantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This\nvectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity\nchanges, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,\nthe tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with\nestimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main\nHoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological\nstability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches\naround a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and\n(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity\naligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures\nboth affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,\ngeneralizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive\nmultidimensional discourse analysis.",

These abilities require integrating logical deduction with\nspatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not\nmeasure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737\nchallenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning\ncapabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows\nfundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,\nand Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and\n63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination\ncascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor\nself-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also\nfragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are\nreordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a\ndiagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development\nof more robust and reliable language models.",

        "abstract": "Industrial recommender systems rely on unique Item Identifiers (ItemIDs).\nHowever, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large,\ndynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail data. Content-based Semantic IDs\n(SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However,\nby ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have\nlimited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral\ninformation but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform\ncontent features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,\ncreating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and\nlong-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise\nCorruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative\nnoise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to\nthe loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The\nequal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of\ndifferent behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to\ndistinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we\npropose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,\nDenoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior\nmodalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this\nframework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive\nbehavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield\nrepresentations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical\nsignals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public\nand large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant\nsuperiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.",

According to the university's ten-year publication data, 7159 papers with\nan h-index of 75 were published between 2014 and 2023, garnering 218572\ncitations. Furthermore, the VOSviewer software mapping approach is used to\nillustrate the stenographical mapping of data through graphs. The findings of\nthis study will contribute to understanding the university's research\nstrengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the\nresults will inform evidence-based decision-making for enhancing research\nstrategies and policies at the University of Ibadan.",

        "title": "A Survey on Unlearning in Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural\nlanguage processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant\nrisks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted\nmaterial, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate\nthese issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the \"right to\nbe forgotten\", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to\nselectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their\noverall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180\npapers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on\nlarge-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel\ntaxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize\nmethods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the\ntraining stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only\nsystematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically\nanalyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical\nguidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and\npromising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform\nand guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.",

        "title": "DEBATE: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Role-Playing LLM Agents in Multi-Agent, Long-Form Debates",
        "abstract": "Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for\naddressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing\nlarge language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like\ninteractions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not\nguarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups\noften produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an\nempirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark\nexplicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between\nmulti-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round\ndebate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107\ncontroversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and\nprivately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and\nidentify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.\nWe further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior\nthrough supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics\n(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper\nsemantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the\npotential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically\nsimulating human-like social dynamics.",
