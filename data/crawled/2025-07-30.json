Although CLIP is successfully trained on\nbillion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training\nfurther to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no\ncuration method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)\nthe English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its\nEnglish-only counterpart, i.e., \"curse of multilinguality\" that is common in\nLLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch\non worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct\nrigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above\nchallenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and\nnon-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2\nViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,\nand surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding\nfactors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual\nbenchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with\n64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.",

In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive survey and taxonomy of FANNS methods and analyze how they are\nbenchmarked in the literature. By doing so, we identify a key challenge in the\ncurrent FANNS landscape: the lack of diverse and realistic datasets,\nparticularly ones derived from the latest transformer-based text embedding\nmodels. To address this, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of embedding\nvectors for the abstracts of over 2.7 million research articles from the arXiv\nrepository, accompanied by 11 real-world attributes such as authors and\ncategories. We benchmark a wide range of FANNS methods on our novel dataset and\nfind that each method has distinct strengths and limitations; no single\napproach performs best across all scenarios. ACORN, for example, supports\nvarious filter types and performs reliably across dataset scales but is often\noutperformed by more specialized methods. SeRF shows excellent performance for\nrange filtering on ordered attributes but cannot handle categorical attributes.\nFiltered-DiskANN and UNG excel on the medium-scale dataset but fail on the\nlarge-scale dataset, highlighting the challenge posed by transformer-based\nembeddings, which are often more than an order of magnitude larger than earlier\nembeddings.

        "abstract": "Modern analytical pipelines routinely deploy multiple deep learning and\nretrieval models that rely on approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) indexes to\nsupport efficient similarity-based search. While many state-of-the-art\nANN-indexes are memory-based (e.g., HNSW and IVF), using multiple ANN indexes\ncreates a competition for limited GPU/CPU memory resources, which in turn\nnecessitates disk-based index structures (e.g., DiskANN or eCP). In typical\nindex implementations, the main component is a complex data structure that is\nserialized to disk and is read either fully at startup time, for memory-based\nindexes, or incrementally at query time, for disk-based indexes. To visualize\nthe index structure, or analyze its quality, complex coding is needed that is\neither embedded in the index implementation or replicates the code that reads\nthe data structure. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach that\nmaps the data structure to a file structure, using a file library, making the\nindex easily readable for any programming language and even human-readable. The\ndisadvantage is that the serialized index is verbose, leading to overhead of\nsearching through the index. The question addressed in this paper is how severe\nthis performance penalty is. To that end, this paper presents eCP-FS, a\nfile-based implementation of eCP, a well-known disk-based ANN index. A\ncomparison with state-of-the-art indexes shows that while eCP-FS is slower, the\nimplementation is nevertheless somewhat competitive even when memory is not\nconstrained. In a memory-constrained scenario, eCP-FS offers a minimal memory\nfootprint, making it ideal for resource-constrained or multi-index\nenvironments.",

This challenge is further\ncompounded in interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics, due to the varied\nprior knowledge and backgrounds. In this paper, we studied how GenAI influences\ninformation search in bioinformatics research: (1) How do interactions with a\nGenAI chatbot influence learner orienteering behaviors?; and (2) How do\nlearners identify information scent in GenAI chatbot responses? We adopted an\nautoethnographic approach to investigate these questions. GenAI was found to\nsupport orienteering once a learning plan was established, but it was\ncounterproductive prior to that. Moreover, traditionally value-rich information\nsources such as bullet points and related terms proved less effective when\napplied to GenAI responses. Information scents were primarily recognized\nthrough the presence or absence of prior knowledge of the domain. These\nfindings suggest that GenAI should be adopted into e-learning environments with\ncaution, particularly in interdisciplinary learning contexts.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\ndiverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized\napplications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is\ntime-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the\nlabel-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging\ntask-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is\nmarkedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our\napproach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts\nare often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying\nlevels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple\nyet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an\ninverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or\nbetter than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being\nsignificantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,\nour experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better\naccuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\\% increase in MMLU score).\nAcross various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our\nalgorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing\nmethods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\\%.",

As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks\nin mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model\nintelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally\ninvolved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of\nconnections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural\nreferences, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately\n300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and\nCartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying\nessential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards\nthe humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on\nthis task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between\nconcepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at\nthe most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA\nmodels reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers\neffectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM\nreasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong\ntransferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing\nthinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor\nreasoning.",

        "abstract": "Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network\narchitectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their\ninterpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast,\nbiological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e.,\nengrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated\nsparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we\nintroduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture\nincorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity\nand sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models\nmemory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving\ntransparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We\nevaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit\nclassification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language\nmodeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and\ngeneralization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM\narchitectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on\nthe large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant\nenhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics.

        "title": "Do Large Language Models Understand Morality Across Cultures?",
        "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as\npowerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about\nembedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their\ntraining data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal\nconsequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which\nLLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.\nSpecifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in\ninternational survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three\ncomplementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by\nmodels versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment\nanalyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM\noutputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative\nprompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that\ncurrent LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral\nvariation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with\nempirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more\nrobust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in\nLLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible\ndevelopment and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical\nalignment.",

        "abstract": "AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated\nretrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates\nwhether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to\nimprove both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that\nautomatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based\nclinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site\ndiagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649\nelectronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for\nextracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to\nmeasure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that\nclinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance\nin high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are\nlimited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also\nleads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were\nconsistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This\nsuggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance\nand are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is\noptimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports\nrather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,\ntraining models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify\nrationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as\nadditional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only\nslightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale\ncoverage) compared to training on additional reports.",

        "title": "LeMix: Unified Scheduling for LLM Training and Inference on Multi-GPU Systems",
        "abstract": "Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both\ninference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data\nand user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct\nservers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU\nidleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our\nempirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request\narrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel\ntraining. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for\nco-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix\nintegrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime\nscheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload\ncharacteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors\nand co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization\nand serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation\nshows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by\nup to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over\ntraditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to\nuncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,\npaving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production\nenvironments.",

        "abstract": "Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of\nmore complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.\nLarge language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities\nand have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to\nSPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process\nis. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for\ninvestigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are\nactually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying\ndifficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for\nverbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order\nto test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given\nthat they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to\nwhat degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they\n\"understand\" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different\nsizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as\nfine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades\nfrom $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the\nsamples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the\nmodel in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of\nlowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and\ncompositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.",

        "abstract": "In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping\npublic perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify\nhyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural\nlanguage processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without\neffective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing\nserious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research\nfine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,\ndesigned to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate\nits performance against traditional machine learning models and implement\nsemi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use\nLIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making\nprocess, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy\nscore of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to\nour trial data.
