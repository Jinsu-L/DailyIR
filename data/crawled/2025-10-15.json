        "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require\naccess to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic\nand ever-changing real-world information in order to address\ninformation-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,\nsuch as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search\nequipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and\npoorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and\nsuboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,\nthe first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web\nsearches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.\nSpecifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops\nof the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively\nadapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling\nself-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an\nonline reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce\nDeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated\npipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This\ndataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual\ninformation, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which\nsearch tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct\nextensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results\nand provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.",

        "abstract": "Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models\n(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding\ncapabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where\na model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual\ngeneration. A model might correctly understand an image based on user\ninstructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.\nThis phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve\nself-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation\nmodule? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a\nself-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing\nUMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own\nunderstanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective\nsignals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional\nhuman-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a\nglobal-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity\nof images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \\textbf{global reward}\nensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a\n\\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads\nto powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance\non T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \\textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82\nto \\textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for\nenabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation\nvia self-rewarding.",

        "abstract": "Voice anonymization techniques have been found to successfully obscure a\nspeaker's acoustic identity in short, isolated utterances in benchmarks such as\nthe VoicePrivacy Challenge. In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in\nisolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone\ncalls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are\navailable, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple\nutterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's\nvocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their\nvoice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content\nanonymization approaches. Our approach performs a contextual rewriting of the\ntranscripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while\npreserving meaning. We present results in a long-form telephone conversation\nsetting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on\nvoice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based\nanonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility.\nOverall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against\ncontent-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure\nanonymity in long-form audio.",

With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni\nLanguage Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in\nparallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer\nunderstanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe\nfine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a\nsystematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the\nperspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an\ninherent \"co-growth\" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To\naddress this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline\nintegrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally\nhallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,\nwe train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed\nperception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the\ncascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on\nMMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and\ndelivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed\ncaptioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and\nachieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the\nvideo-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni\ndetailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for\ndetailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,\nefficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality\ndetailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such\ndetailed captions.",

We developed an AI-based\njudge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE),\nand deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against\nhuman expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on\n$309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we\nfound no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the\ntwo approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated\n$3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an\nexcellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a\nfull week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during\ndeployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level\nmatching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency,\nunderscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human\ndecision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct\nanswering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet\nour experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial\nmode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To\nunderstand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing\ncontrollability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)\nusing think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same\nquestion, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase\nstrategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think\ntraining. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,\ncompared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while\nsignificantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)\nand occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\\texttt{wait}'' (from\n$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500).

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by\nretrieving external documents. As an emerging form of RAG, parametric\nretrieval-augmented generation (PRAG) encodes documents as model parameters\n(i.e., LoRA modules) and injects these representations into the model during\ninference, enabling interaction between the LLM and documents at parametric\nlevel. Compared with directly placing documents in the input context, PRAG is\nmore efficient and has the potential to offer deeper model-document\ninteraction. Despite its growing attention, the mechanism underlying parametric\ninjection remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic\nstudy of PRAG to clarify the role of parametric injection, showing that\nparameterized documents capture only partial semantic information of documents,\nand relying on them alone yields inferior performance compared to interaction\nat text level. However, these parametric representations encode high-level\ndocument information that can enhance the model's understanding of documents\nwithin the input context. When combined parameterized documents with textual\ndocuments, the model can leverage relevant information more effectively and\nbecome more robust to noisy inputs, achieving better performance than either\nsource alone. We recommend jointly using parameterized and textual documents\nand advocate for increasing the information content of parametric\nrepresentations to advance PRAG.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning\ncapabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories\n(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model\nusing verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating\nhigh-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This\npaper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially\nreduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class\nof problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,\nprocedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in\ncontent such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the\nsolution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the\nsuccess of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable\nmodels to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic\nmatching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral\nevidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of\nrationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,\nwe propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet\neffective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with\ntask-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.\nExperiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR\nperformance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest\nthat large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based\nautomatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning\npatterns.",

Existing approaches rely on\nstatistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between\nLLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in\nreal-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to\nparaphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic\ndiversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose\nStyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits\nLLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify\nstylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and\ncontinuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,\nStyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and\nLLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables\naccurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access\nto model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five\ndiverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,\ndemonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain\naccuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing\nbaselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial\nperturbations and mixed human-AI content.

Existing approaches to\nimproving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such\nas prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These\nworks treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does\nthe LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,\nparticularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a\nprobing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe\nthree findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest\nas latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often\namplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,\nwe propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a\nframework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level\nknowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,\nand (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to\naccurately integrate retrieved evidence.

This simulation incorporates a\nresearch agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,\nwhich assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct\nhuman annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based\nreviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores\nfor LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than\nhuman-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored\npapers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple\nrevisions.

These results highlight the risks and\nequity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are\ndeployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution.

The principle of sparse\nactivation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active\nexperts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU\nDRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by\nthe limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect.

We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline\nfor automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large\nlanguage models (LLMs).

We demonstrate\nthe pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study\nof variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the\nOpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical\nAmerican English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two\nsophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform\na range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,\nopening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation\nrequires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.",

We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for\nsystematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.\nOur approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading\ninitial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are\nchallenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that\nseparates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).\nUsing controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five\nstate-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under\nshallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn\nsettings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude\nSonnet 4.

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various\nfields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question\nanswering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency\nmodeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which\nweakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the\n''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information\nin the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global\ndependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and\nsimple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose\nDual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The\nContextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by\nassessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and\nposition-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)\nmodule enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information\nexchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in\nlong-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play\nsolution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.\nExtensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across\nmainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score\nimprovement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and\nQwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of\nboth the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix\nfurther validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.",

Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards\n(RLVR) offers a natural solution by enabling on-policy sampling of harder\nnegatives and grounding optimization in explicit reward signals. However,\napplying RLVR to generative recommenders remains non-trivial. Its unique\ngeneration space often leads to invalid or repetitive items that undermine\nsampling efficiency, and ranking supervision is sparse since most items receive\nidentical zero rewards. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforced\nPreference Optimization for Recommendation (ReRe), a reinforcement-based\nparadigm tailored to LLM-based recommenders, an important direction in\ngenerative recommendation. ReRe incorporates constrained beam search to improve\nsampling efficiency and diversify hard negatives, while augmenting rule-based\naccuracy rewards with auxiliary ranking rewards for finer-grained supervision.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that ReRe\nconsistently outperforms both traditional and LLM-based recommenders in ranking\nperformance.

        "abstract": "Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,\nespecially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),\nwhich encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support\nthis task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical\nconcept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating\nthat certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To\naddress this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework\nfor Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts\nwithin KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related\ntextual representations of biomedical entities from large language models\n(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By\ninjecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the\nrepresentation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of\nunder-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks\ndemonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different\nscenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its\nrobustness and effectiveness.

We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax\nfunction, which creates \"Artificial Certainty\" by collapsing ambiguous\nattention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty\ninformation at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,\nwhich replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based\non evidential theory. CAM produces a \"credal set\" (a set of distributions)\ninstead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring\nmodel uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as\nevidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers\nstandard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,\nrepresenting ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies\nout-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces\nconfident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a\nnew architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that\nintegrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a\nfoundation for more reliable AI.",

We address this limitation with\nthree key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a\ntarget-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a\nlightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final\nattribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM\noutputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden\nrepresentations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute\nintensity targets.

In this work, we reveal\nthrough systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input\nperformance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between\nspeech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality\ngap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and\nspeech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech\nand text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction\n(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean\ndistance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly\ncorrelated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous\ntoken-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is\nobserved. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify\ntoken-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the\nmodality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on\ncritical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These\nstrategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.\nOur study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap\nand alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological\nguidance for future optimization.",

Prior work has focused on\nlargely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple\nmechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging\nsetting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only\n\"one life\" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We\nintroduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through\nconditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming\nframework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,\nactivating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph\nthat routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding\nscaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,\nhierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with\nsparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding\nconstraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state\nranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible\nones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that\nclosely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,\nour reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,\nobject-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on\nthat state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from\nminimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23\nscenarios tested.

        "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from\ninefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are\nlimited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In\nthis paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that\nautomatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to\ngenerate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a\ntaxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it\nsignificantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,\ndrastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction\nfollowing. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our\nanalysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning\nbehaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific\nbehavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these\nbehaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs\nreasoning with task demands.

Additionally, the\nmodel utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual\nembeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent\nembeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the\nheterogeneous scholarly network.

This approach\noverlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,\nwhere different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to\nabstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm\nby introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO\nto distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate\n(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on\nstate-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for\nsurgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,\ndemonstrate significant and predictable improvements.

To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a\nframework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across\nmultiple stages.

Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an\nalternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and\noverlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior.\nWe propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent\nEvaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates\ntop-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles,\ngrounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate\nbottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product\ncatalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate\ninteractions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a\ncompany's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this\napproach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also\nidentifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an\nevaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.",

        "abstract": "Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in\nformal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,\nhowever, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical\nproblems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion\nsuch as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models\n(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their\nconjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or\nproof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this\ngap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the\nevaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing\ncapabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation\npipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and\nDeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is\nsubstantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during\nevaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We\ndesign an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and\nautoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first\nsuccessful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1\nand 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite\nknowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation\nperformance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and\ninvestigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.\nFinally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward\nimproving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.",

First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that\norchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation\ntime from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,\nwe conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and\nbenchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across\n9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer\nservice with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising\ninsights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of\nruns.

Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM\nperformance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to\ntrivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These\nfindings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs\nmay learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only\nlimited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the\nutility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on\nimproving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.",

        "abstract": "Deep Research (DR) agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform\ncomplex, multi-step research by decomposing tasks, retrieving online\ninformation, and synthesizing detailed reports. However, the misuse of LLMs\nwith such powerful capabilities can lead to even greater risks. This is\nespecially concerning in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive domains such as\nbiosecurity, where DR can generate a professional report containing detailed\nforbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, we have found such risks in practice:\nsimply submitting a harmful query, which a standalone LLM directly rejects, can\nelicit a detailed and dangerous report from DR agents. This highlights the\nelevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet,\njailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks,\nas they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap,\nwe propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects\nmalicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes\nharmful queries as academic research questions. We conducted extensive\nexperiments across different LLMs and various safety benchmarks, including\ngeneral and biosecurity forbidden prompts. These experiments reveal 3 key\nfindings: (1) Alignment of the LLMs often fail in DR agents, where harmful\nprompts framed in academic terms can hijack agent intent; (2) Multi-step\nplanning and execution weaken the alignment, revealing systemic vulnerabilities\nthat prompt-level safeguards cannot address; (3) DR agents not only bypass\nrefusals but also produce more coherent, professional, and dangerous content,\ncompared with standalone LLMs. These results demonstrate a fundamental\nmisalignment in DR agents and call for better alignment techniques tailored to\nDR agents.

        "abstract": "Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a\nfundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding\ncatastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied\nsynthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing\ntask performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain\npoorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the\ninterplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when\nadapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our\ntarget objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically\nevaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We\nanalyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our\nexperiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific\nperformance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide\nempirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on\ncomputational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation\nwith significantly reduced training costs.",

To\ndisentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings\n-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --\nachieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP\ncaptures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is\nmore responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated\ninto VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive\ntasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of\nlanguage supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield\nlimited gains.

        "abstract": "Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter\nharmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator\nto reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it\noften pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision\nboundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose\nBoundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly\nsteers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of\njailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and\nthe utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive\nworkflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the\neffectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and\nnoise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring\nstreams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally\nunsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in\nLLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but\nthe challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In\nthis paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention\nbudget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design\nprinciple for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as\ncompression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most\nrelevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building\nbenchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating\ntoken-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our\nvision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in\nnoisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable\nLLM--data integration.",

        "title": "PHANTOM RECALL: When Familiar Puzzles Fool Smart Models",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear\nadept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning\nunderlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently\nrely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When\npuzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a\nstriking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?\nTo what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general\nway of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these\nthings systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25\nwell-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve\nreasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate\neleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom\nrecall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious\nrationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this\nissue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to\ndetect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error\ncategories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these\ncategories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models\nsignificantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom\nrecall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs\noften fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap\nbetween linguistic fluency and logical understanding.",
