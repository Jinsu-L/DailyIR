        "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems,\nestimates user click likelihood using historical behavioral data. Modeling user\nbehavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has\ngained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual\nmodeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior\nsequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty\nseparators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM\npre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention\nscatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior\nboundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.\nTo address this, we propose $\\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing\nbehavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired\nby attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically\nregulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we\ninsert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating\nrecommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable\nattention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy\nthat explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink\nmechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral\ncorrelations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source\ndatasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the\nmethod's effectiveness across scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Neural ranking has become a cornerstone of modern information retrieval.\nWhile single vector search remains the dominant paradigm, it suffers from the\nshortcoming of compressing all the information into a single vector. This\ncompression leads to notable performance degradation in out-of-domain,\nlong-context, and reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Multi-vector approaches\npioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual\ntoken embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This\narchitecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced\nout-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex\nretrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear\ntheoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late\ninteraction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts,\nprimarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and\nexperimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a\nstreamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support\nmulti-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training,\nadvanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal\ncode changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering\nmulti-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to\naccelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models,\nthereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems.

        "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to\naddress hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the\nintegration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative,\nintroduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination\nproblems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse\ndistribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical\nrelationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that\nlead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose\nMultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source\nretrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our\nframework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module\nthat employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical\nrelationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the\nsparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that\nimplements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both\ngraph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable\ninformation nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source\ninconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and\ntwo multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the\nreliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source\nscenarios. \\textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in\nhttps://github.com/wuwenlong123/MultiRAG.",

To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal\nevaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each\ncomponent within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880\npages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4\ndocument types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data\ncontamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence\npages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.\nOur comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4\nMLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text\nand visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building\nstronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the\nover-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to\nprovide answer even without evidence support.

To address\nthese issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs\nwith access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and\nreal-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new\nsecurity vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external\ndatabase can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior\nwork has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely\nheavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval\nand generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack\non the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and\nblack-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an\nattacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token\nlevel, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.\nExtensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG\nconsistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end\nattack effectiveness.

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a novel Information Retrieval (IR) System tailored to assist\nsupervisors in drafting both consistent and effective measures. This system\ningests findings from on-site investigations. It then retrieves the most\nrelevant historical findings and their associated measures from a comprehensive\ndatabase, providing a solid basis for supervisors to write well-informed\nmeasures for new findings. Utilizing a blend of lexical, semantic, and Capital\nRequirements Regulation (CRR) fuzzy set matching techniques, the IR system\nensures the retrieval of findings that closely align with current cases. The\nperformance of this system, particularly in scenarios with partially labeled\ndata, is validated through a Monte Carlo methodology, showcasing its robustness\nand accuracy. Enhanced by a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder for\nfine-tuning, the final model achieves a Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of\n0.83 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92. These scores surpass those\nof both standalone lexical models such as BM25 and semantic BERT-like models.",

        "abstract": "Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for\nenhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra\ntraining. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and\nSelf-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model\n(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling\n(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent\nCollaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination\nof LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model\ncollaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a\ncurated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to\nselect the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking\n(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that\nthe proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be\nreleased at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.",

        "abstract": "Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nis an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and\nevaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by\ndesign. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible\ninstantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of\ncorrectness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an\nLLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better\nthan those of a standard RAG pipeline.",

Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset\nof texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the\nLLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including\nperforming post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and\ntrustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,\nstate-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation\ncost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a\nsingle response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context\ntraceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a\nprompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques\ndesigned to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical\ninsights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for\nAttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and\nefficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods.

Previous research has\naddressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a\nmulti-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach\nsuffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the\nloss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic\nthat are less appealing to human readers.\n  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to\nimprove the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core\ncomponents of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model\ncomprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most\nimportant memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory\nstorage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To\nincorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle\nframework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain\nfactors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates\nthe similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by\nbuilding a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we\nestablish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction\nthrough dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it\nremains consistent and logical.

        "abstract": "Despite significant advancements, current large language models (LLMs) and\nvision-language models (LVLMs) continue to struggle with complex, multi-step,\ncross-modal common sense reasoning tasks, often exhibiting a lack of\n\"deliberative thinking.\" They tend to rely on superficial associations rather\nthan deep, chained inference, particularly when integrating visual information\nwith abstract concepts. To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal\nReasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense\nreasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference\nmechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,\ngenerating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework\nintegrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking\ndown problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for\ncontextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating\nlogical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative\nRefinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built\nupon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning\n(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source\nLVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It\nattains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline\nby +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning\nscenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the\ncritical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative\nrefinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.",

        "abstract": "Depression is a pervasive mental health condition that affects hundreds of\nmillions of individuals worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to\nbarriers in traditional clinical access and pervasive stigma. Social media\nplatforms, and Reddit in particular, offer rich, user-generated narratives that\ncan reveal early signs of depressive symptomatology. However, existing\ncomputational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not\ndepressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the\nstandard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both\nclinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce\nReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each\nexhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the\nnine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a\nconcise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an\nexploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and\nemotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media\nnarratives. Compared to prior resources, ReDSM5 uniquely combines\nsymptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the\ndevelopment of models that not only detect depression but also generate\nhuman-interpretable reasoning. We establish baseline benchmarks for both\nmulti-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing\nreference results for future research on detection and interpretability.",

We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a\nlightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian\nnoise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based\nscreening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity\nestimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration\nto balance privacy with generation quality. A \\renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)\naccountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit\nper-response $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.\nUnlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is\nmodel-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving\nresponse utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based\ndefenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in\nRAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy\nsolutions in sensitive domains.

        "abstract": "Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks\nremains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow\ntwo paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering,\nor continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit\nlimitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based\ntechniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these\nconstraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt\nembeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples\ntraining from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise\nembedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only\noptimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained\ncalibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning\ncapability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive\nevaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal\njudgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning\nprompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\\% to 58.96\\% on\nmathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model\nscales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for\nsmaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt\nengineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work\nestablishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task\nadaptation.",

Low-rank family\nadapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while\nmaintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness\ndue to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.\nWe propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker\nadapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture\nof Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that\nmeasures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive\nadaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better\ntrade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware\nefficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix\noperations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct\nextensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks\nusing low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models.

        "abstract": "Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research\nhas primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,\ntheir potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To\nfill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),\na new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two\nreasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.\nSpecifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:\none in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of\nThinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,\nusing a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both\ncandidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\\%\nin GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,\nresulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms\nfew-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer\nrobustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to\ntraining-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on\nout-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the\ncalibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes\nconsistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural\nthinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between\nactual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round\nof thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we\ndiscuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL\nresearch in RLLMs.",

        "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different\napplications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in\nvarious tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using\nexplicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion\nand short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit\nforms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,\nwe investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in\npsychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of\nnarrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories\ncontaining short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or\nsix) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related\nstory endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story\nchanges in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)\nWhile models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned\nprompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes\nmitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same\ngender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias\nand female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological\nground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with\nmodel size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of\npsychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.",

In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as\nnatural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender\nsystems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from\nonline streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to\ndifferent recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream\ntasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational\nconstraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert\nParadigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale\nrecommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,\ncross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This\nknowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight,\nsurface-specific ``expert\" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to\nadapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.\nTo meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a\nproduction-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving,\nlogging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now\ndeployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating\nonline metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while\nimproving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of\na Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven,\ncompute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of\nscaling laws in recommender systems.",

In this work,\nmotivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode\nsemantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with\nhuman judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and\nefficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring,\nvia internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by\naggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from\na softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully\nleverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the\nlimitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the\nstandard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman\ncorrelation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the\nbest baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches\nor outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications,\nsuch as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the\neffectiveness of our method.",

To\nanswer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues\nto the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue\ncorpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly\nconverge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative\nto the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,\nwe observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with\ninstruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained\ncounterparts.

Our\ninvestigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the\nprimary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this\nissue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous\nreasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for\nsatisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate\ninstructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain\nvalid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard,\neasy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to\ncurate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization\nof the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns.\nSubsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning\n(Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL)\nreinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach\nencourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering\ngeneralizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.\nExtensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate\nremarkable performance improvements across various model scales.

We evaluate using standard misinformation\ndatasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning\nmodels and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,\nquality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against\nrewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms\nbaseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,\nand resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for\ntrustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created\na fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,\nmanual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this\nchallenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts\nprotocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution\ndemonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce\ndevelopment overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent\nexecution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show\n60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up\nto 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing\nfunction calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights\ninto tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM\napplication development.",
