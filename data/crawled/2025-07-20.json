        "abstract": "Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that\nfollow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their\nsupervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,\nedited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect\nonly prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical\nplausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated\nedit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an\nautomated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,\nresolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative\nmodels and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned\nGemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,\nremoving any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and\ncompositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,\nenabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most\nrepetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training\nwithout human labeling effort. To democratize research in this\nresource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k\nhigh-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses\nall public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source\nfine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our\nexperiments.",

However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and\nrequires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements\nin Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this\nanalysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities\nfor interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in\nproviding detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for\nintegrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted\nanalysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,\nseveral LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the\nquality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different\nNDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.\nEach LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed\ndescriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and\ndemonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine\nmodels provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of\ntopics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models\nare summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of\nthe bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more\neffective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to\nsignificantly improve efficiency and accuracy.

However, their unpredictability,\ncombined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous\nevaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems\ndid well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not\nin brevity.\n  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to\nadapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting\ntheir deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.",

        "abstract": "Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an\nElectronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a\npatient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their\nimportance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For\ninstance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III\n(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress\nnotes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the\ndataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different\naspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered\nEvidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by\nsimulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress\nnotes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically\ninformed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant\ncontent from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to\nprompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and\ntemporally aware progress notes.\n  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and\ncomplete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong\nlongitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,\nsurpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative\ncoherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved\ndownstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical\ndecision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in\nreal-world healthcare settings.",

While citation graphs are a valuable means to support the outcome of\nrecommender systems, their use in personalized academic search (with, e.g.\nnodes as papers and edges as citations) is still under-explored.\n  Existing personalized models for academic search often struggle to fully\ncapture users' academic interests.

This allows user models to capture both explicit relationships and\nhidden structures in citation graphs and paper content.

This issue is critical in multilingual societies where\nCS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS,\nwidely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR\nfor Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic\nCS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data\nwith language tokens.

In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,\ngenerating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named\nQuery Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the\ncentral task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the\nrise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method\nto increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is\nstill a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and\ntrustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have\nno control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already\nincluded in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that\nevaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a\nnatural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL\ngeneration, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with \"anonymized\" knowledge\ninjection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of\nthe training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will\nhelp to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly\nbe achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.\nLLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any\nknowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM,\ns.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is\npossible.",

In this\npaper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific\narticles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct\napproaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient\nparagraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking\nthese questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and\nsubsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content\nof the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires\ncomparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach\nleverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by\nfine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles\nand using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction\nmethod to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as\nthe centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure\nassesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article\ncompared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs\nusing both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)\nthrough a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions\nand answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively\ncaptures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings\nindicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is\ncrucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.",

        "title": "An Enhanced Model-based Approach for Short Text Clustering",
        "abstract": "Short text clustering has become increasingly important with the popularity\nof social media like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook. Existing methods can be\nbroadly categorized into two paradigms: topic model-based approaches and deep\nrepresentation learning-based approaches. This task is inherently challenging\ndue to the sparse, large-scale, and high-dimensional characteristics of the\nshort text data. Furthermore, the computational intensity required by\nrepresentation learning significantly increases the running time. To address\nthese issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet\nMultinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and\nhigh dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for\neach cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further\nrefinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further\noptimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively\nadjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that\nreveals more topic-related information. Additionally, strategic cluster merging\nis employed to refine clustering granularity, better aligning the predicted\ndistribution with the true category distribution. We conduct extensive\nexperiments, comparing our methods with both classical and state-of-the-art\napproaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and\neffectiveness of our methods.

        "abstract": "Language models are highly sensitive to prompt formulations - small changes\nin input can drastically alter their output. This raises a critical question:\nTo what extent can prompt sensitivity be exploited to generate inapt content?\nIn this paper, we investigate how discrete components of prompt design\ninfluence the generation of inappropriate content in Visual Language Models\n(VLMs). Specifically, we analyze the impact of three key factors on successful\njailbreaks: (a) the inclusion of detailed visual information, (b) the presence\nof adversarial examples, and (c) the use of positively framed beginning\nphrases. Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between\nbenign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this\nability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three\nfactors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that\neven a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model\ntoward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework\nthat utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which\nsubstantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images.\nFinally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless,\ncan be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring\nthe subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.",

Behavioral science studies suggest\nthat screen-based news reading contains three successive steps: scanning, title\nreading, and then clicking. Adhering to these steps, we find that intra-news\nentity interest dominates the scanning stage, while the inter-news entity\ninterest guides title reading and influences click decisions. Unfortunately,\ncurrent methods overlook the unique utility of entities in news recommendation.\nTo this end, we propose a novel method called IP2 to probe entity-guided\nreading interest at both intra- and inter-news levels. At the intra-news level,\na Transformer-based entity encoder is devised to aggregate mentioned entities\nin the news title into one signature entity. Then, a signature entity-title\ncontrastive pre-training is adopted to initialize entities with proper meanings\nusing the news story context, which in the meantime facilitates us to probe for\nintra-news entity interest. As for the inter-news level, a dual tower user\nencoder is presented to capture inter-news reading interest from both the title\nmeaning and entity sides. In addition to highlighting the contribution of\ninter-news entity guidance, a cross-tower attention link is adopted to\ncalibrate title reading interest using inter-news entity interest, thus further\naligning with real-world behavior.

While recent\nresearch has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either\nhuman-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing\nthese texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic\nlevels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of\nhuman-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11\ndifferent LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency\nlength and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and\nmachine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition\ncontrols and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that\nhuman-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more\ndiverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set\nof features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show\nstylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in\nour features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability\namong human-written and machine-generated texts.

Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) thus plays\na crucial role by enabling the evaluation of recommendation policies using only\noffline logged data naturally collected on the platform. However, unlike\nconventional recommendation settings, the large scale and bidirectional nature\nof user interactions in matching platforms introduce variance issues and\nexacerbate reward sparsity, making standard OPE methods unreliable.

Existing VolVis approaches have explored\nnon-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,\nand informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods\noften rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single\nstyle, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we\nadvocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian\nprimitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style\ntransfer and real-time rendering.

        "abstract": "Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum\ndisorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical\nassessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are\nresource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of\nlinguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The\nuse of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought\nto reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the\nutility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity\nrequires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries\n(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream\nnarratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside\nestablished coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to\npredict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone\nrobustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only\nmodels, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to\n\\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best\n\\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance\ngains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all\ncontexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These\nfindings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses\nprovide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and\nadvance automated speech analysis in psychosis.",
