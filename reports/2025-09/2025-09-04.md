#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: E-commerce Search
- **Aim**: To address the limitations of traditional multi-stage cascading architectures (MCA) in e-commerce search by proposing a novel end-to-end generative framework called OneSearch.
- **Rationale**: Traditional MCA systems suffer from fragmented computation, conflicting optimization objectives across stages, and cold-start issues. OneSearch aims to overcome these challenges by adopting a generative retrieval paradigm.
- **Ground**: Existing generative retrieval (GR) models for e-commerce search struggle with handling redundant and irrelevant information, preserving core attribute representations, and accurately uncovering user search intent.
- **Experiment**: OneSearch was evaluated offline using real user search logs and A/B tested on the KuaiShou mall search platform. It achieved comparable ranking accuracy to MCA systems, increased order volume by up to 3.22%, and significantly reduced operational expenditure.
- **Takeaway**: OneSearch demonstrates the effectiveness of a generative retrieval approach for e-commerce search. Its success is attributed to robust user modeling, effective item representation, and preference-aware training. Future research will explore online encoding, multi-modal features, and reinforcement learning to further enhance its capabilities.

#### Abstract
> Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading
architectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall,
pre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational
efficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented
computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which
ultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose
\textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative
framework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key
innovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE)
module, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes
while maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view
user behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user
IDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences
to model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward
System (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive
reward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive
offline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's
superior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online
A/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure
position, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\% item CTR,
+2.40\% buyer, and +3.22\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces
operational expenditure by 75.40\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from
3.26\% to 27.32\%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple
search scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of
millions of PVs daily.

### 2. Training LLMs to be Better Text Embedders through Bidirectional Reconstruction

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 11
- **Authors**: Chang Su, Dengliang Shi, Siyuan Huang, Jintao Du, Changhua Meng, Yu Cheng, Weiqiang Wang, Zhouhan Lin
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03020v2>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-03 04:55:26
- **Comment**: accepted by EMNLP 2025 Main Conference
- **Topic Keywords**: query, ranking, rag, retrieval, rank
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your interests in Information Retrieval, specifically in the area of text embeddings and ranking models. The proposed method of bidirectional reconstruction tasks improves LLM performance on a text embedding benchmark, which is closely related to your focus on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Enhancing Text Embedding Capabilities of Large Language Models
- **Aim**: To improve the bidirectional alignment and semantic information captured by embeddings in LLMs
- **Rationale**: Existing contrastive learning methods may not fully capture the bidirectional relationships between queries and documents.
- **Ground**: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their text embedding capabilities
- **Experiment**: Two-stage training framework called 'Anchor embeddings' involving bidirectional reconstruction (EBQ2D and EBD2Q) followed by contrastive learning on the E5 dataset using InfoNCE loss.
- **Takeaway**: Anchor embeddings significantly outperform baselines on the MTEB benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art results at the 1B scale. The method demonstrates faster convergence and highlights the importance of bidirectional reconstruction for enhancing semantic similarity.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

### 3. HF-RAG: Hierarchical Fusion-based RAG with Multiple Sources and Rankers

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Payel Santra, Madhusudan Ghosh, Debasis Ganguly, Partha Basuchowdhuri, Sudip Kumar Naskar
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02837v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-02 21:03:40
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval, rank
- **Reason**: The paper HF-RAG explores the combination of heterogeneous sources in retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which aligns with the user's interests in Information Retrieval and query understanding. The use of rank fusion and z-score transformation to merge retrieval scores also relates to the user's focus on ranking models and real-time relevance optimization. However, the specific application to fact verification and RAG may not be a central match for the user's research themes.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Aim**: To enhance RAG performance, particularly in out-of-domain generalization, by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data sources.
- **Rationale**: Existing RAG methods often struggle with out-of-domain generalization due to limited training data. Combining labeled and unlabeled data can improve performance and generalization capabilities.
- **Ground**: The paper builds upon previous work in RAG, fact verification, and information retrieval.
- **Experiment**: HF-RAG is evaluated on fact verification tasks using the FEVER dataset for supervised and L-RAG-based approaches, and Wikipedia 2018 dump for U-RAG. Out-of-domain evaluation is performed on Climate-FEVER and SciFact datasets.
- **Takeaway**: HF-RAG significantly outperforms baselines, especially on scientific claims, demonstrating better generalization capabilities. Combining multiple retrieval models and using z-score transformation for inter-source fusion are key factors in its success.

#### Abstract
> Leveraging both labeled (input-output associations) and unlabeled data (wider
contextual grounding) may provide complementary benefits in retrieval augmented
generation (RAG). However, effectively combining evidence from these
heterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are
not inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of
multiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method
first aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard
rank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we
standardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying
z-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two
sources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating
that it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or
source and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.

### 4. LMEnt: A Suite for Analyzing Knowledge in Language Models from Pretraining Data to Representations

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Daniela Gottesman, Alon Gilae-Dotan, Ido Cohen, Yoav Gur-Arieh, Marius Mosbach, Ori Yoran, Mor Geva
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03405v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-03 15:31:18
- **Comment**: Submitted to TACL, August 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the area of query understanding and ranking models. Although it focuses on Language Models, it explores the internal processes of knowledge acquisition and representation, which is a deep semantic understanding aspect. The paper's emphasis on analyzing connections between entity mentions and downstream performance also aligns with your interests in user behavior modeling.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Knowledge Acquisition in Large Language Models
- **Aim**: To investigate how large language models (LLMs) acquire and represent factual knowledge.
- **Rationale**: Understanding how LLMs learn and store facts is crucial for building more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.
- **Ground**: LMEnt, an open-source suite of 12 language models with entity annotations in their pretraining data.
- **Experiment**: Comparing LMEnt's performance to traditional methods using entity-based retrieval and analyzing its training process.
- **Takeaway**: Entity-based retrieval is superior for factual knowledge acquisition, subject-answer co-occurrence correlates with performance, and models learn and forget facts throughout training.

#### Abstract
> Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require
world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data
into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly
understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs
with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.
To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing
knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a
knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based
on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that
outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained
models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with
comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.
Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing
connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,
and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the
utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding
that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We
release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge
representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

### 5. RankGraph: Unified Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Cross-Domain Recommendation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 10
- **Authors**: Renzhi Wu, Junjie Yang, Li Chen, Hong Li, Li Yu, Hong Yan
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02942v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-03 02:16:50
- **Comment**: RecSys 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, click, conversion rate, retrieval, recommend, rank
- **Reason**: The paper RankGraph focuses on cross-domain recommendation systems, which is somewhat related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. However, it primarily deals with recommender systems, which is not the user's primary focus. The use of graph learning and neural networks is relevant, but the context is more aligned with recommender systems than information retrieval.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Recommendation Systems
- **Aim**: Enhance recommendation foundation models (FMs) by integrating user and item relationships across multiple product domains.
- **Rationale**: Current recommendation systems often struggle to capture complex cross-domain interactions.
- **Ground**: Heterogeneous graph encompassing users, posts, ads, and their interactions (direct and indirect).
- **Experiment**: GPU-based Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Graph Feature Encoder, Information Aggregation (RGCN-style), and Contrastive Learning. Trained using triplet loss and InfoNCE loss.
- **Takeaway**: RankGraph significantly improves click-through rates (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests.

#### Abstract
> Cross-domain recommendation systems face the challenge of integrating
fine-grained user and item relationships across various product domains. To
address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework
designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models
(FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes
and edges across multiple products, RankGraph enables the integration of
complex relationships between users, posts, ads, and other entities. Our
framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive
learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and
user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time
clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained
representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them
with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements
in click (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests, showcasing
its effectiveness in cross-domain recommendation scenarios.

### 6. Grocery to General Merchandise: A Cross-Pollination Recommender using LLMs and Real-Time Cart Context

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 9
- **Authors**: Akshay Kekuda, Murali Mohana Krishna Dandu, Rimita Lahiri, Shiqin Cai, Sinduja Subramaniam, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02890v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-02 23:28:34
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval, recommend, shopping, commerce, e-commerce, rank
- **Reason**: The paper explores recommender systems in the e-commerce domain, leveraging LLMs and real-time cart context. While it touches on aspects of information retrieval, such as ranking models, its primary focus is on recommender systems rather than core IR topics like query understanding or user behavior modeling. The paper's relevance is somewhat related to the user's interests in NLP and data mining, but it does not align with the user's core research themes in IR.

#### Abstract
> Modern e-commerce platforms strive to enhance customer experience by
providing timely and contextually relevant recommendations. However,
recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping --
such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet
under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP)
framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise
cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations
and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A
candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and
LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a
transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context
and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and
online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based
retrieval, and 27\% NDCG\@4 lift using cart context-based ranker. Our work
contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader
insights for e-commerce systems.

### 7. Measuring Scalar Constructs in Social Science with LLMs

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Hauke Licht, Rupak Sarkar, Patrick Y. Wu, Pranav Goel, Niklas Stoehr, Elliott Ash, Alexander Miserlis Hoyle
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03116v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-03 08:19:13
- **Comment**: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main)
- **Topic Keywords**: pointwise, pairwise, search
- **Reason**: This paper explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in measuring scalar constructs in social science, which is somewhat related to my interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and related topics. However, the focus on social science and scalar constructs is not directly aligned with my primary research themes in Information Retrieval (IR) and Search technologies. The paper's findings on LLM-based approaches may have some indirect relevance to my work on query understanding and ranking models, but it is not a central match.

#### Abstract
> Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or
emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech
is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes.
Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring
scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises
questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct
measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the
political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct
pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,
token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields
actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate
pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with
bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with
pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking
pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning
smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the
performance of prompted LLMs.

### 8. RecBase: Generative Foundation Model Pretraining for Zero-Shot Recommendation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Sashuai Zhou, Weinan Gan, Qijiong Liu, Ke Lei, Jieming Zhu, Hai Huang, Yan Xia, Ruiming Tang, Zhenhua Dong, Zhou Zhao
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03131v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-03 08:33:43
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, recommend
- **Reason**: While the paper touches on aspects of information retrieval, such as query understanding and ranking models, its primary focus is on recommender systems, which is a secondary interest of yours. The use of generative foundation models and autoregressive objectives is related to NLP, but the application to recommendation tasks is not directly aligned with your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation have shown promise, yet their
cross-domain generalization is hindered by a fundamental mismatch between
language-centric pretraining and the recommendation task. Existing methods,
relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user
interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a
domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented
objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus
with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance
cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we
introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept
identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary
sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture
complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our
1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up
to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.

### 9. Learning Mechanism Underlying NLP Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Yarden Tzach, Ronit D. Gross, Ella Koresh, Shalom Rosner, Or Shpringer, Tal Halevi, Ido Kanter
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03407v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-03 15:32:50
- **Comment**: 46 pages, 18 figures, 10 tables
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper explores the mechanism underlying NLP pre-training and fine-tuning, which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on NLP pre-training and fine-tuning is not directly aligned with the user's primary research interests in IR and Search technologies.

#### Abstract
> Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of
meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture
on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to
implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the
mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay
between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.
The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)
increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over
all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which
increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among
tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as
inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened
along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance
considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,
higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though
the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.
These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy
along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction
confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input
meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match
tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image
classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in
fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results
were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and
fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

### 10. A Plug-and-play Model-agnostic Embedding Enhancement Approach for Explainable Recommendation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Yunqi Mi, Boyang Yan, Guoshuai Zhao, Jialie Shen, Xueming Qian
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03130v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-03 08:32:20
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend, personalization
- **Reason**: The paper discusses a model-agnostic embedding enhancement approach for explainable recommendation, which is somewhat related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. However, it focuses on recommender systems, which is a secondary interest of the user. The paper's emphasis on explainability and real-time relevance optimization is also relevant, but not a central match to the user's primary focus on query understanding and ranking models.

#### Abstract
> Existing multimedia recommender systems provide users with suggestions of
media by evaluating the similarities, such as games and movies. To enhance the
semantics and explainability of embeddings, it is a consensus to apply
additional information (e.g., interactions, contexts, popularity). However,
without systematic consideration of representativeness and value, the utility
and explainability of embedding drops drastically. Hence, we introduce RVRec, a
plug-and-play model-agnostic embedding enhancement approach that can improve
both personality and explainability of existing systems. Specifically, we
propose a probability-based embedding optimization method that uses a
contrastive loss based on negative 2-Wasserstein distance to learn to enhance
the representativeness of the embeddings. In addtion, we introduce a reweighing
method based on multivariate Shapley values strategy to evaluate and explore
the value of interactions and embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple
backbone recommenders and real-world datasets show that RVRec can improve the
personalization and explainability of existing recommenders, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Submitted**: 2025-09-03 17:01:38
- **Comment**: 6 papges
- **Topic Keywords**: search
- **Reason**: The paper explores reinforcement learning in text-based games, which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on text games and agent learning is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes. The connection to deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization is also not explicitly mentioned.

#### Abstract
> As AI technology advances, research in playing text-based games with agents
has becomeprogressively popular. In this paper, a novel approach to agent
design and agent learning ispresented with the context of reinforcement
learning. A model of deep learning is first applied toprocess game text and
build a world model. Next, the agent is learned through a policy gradient-based
deep reinforcement learning method to facilitate conversion from state value to
optimal policy.The enhanced agent works better in several text-based game
experiments and significantlysurpasses previous agents on game completion ratio
and win rate. Our study introduces novelunderstanding and empirical ground for
using reinforcement learning for text games and sets thestage for developing
and optimizing reinforcement learning agents for more general domains
andproblems.

### 12. Enhancing Interpretability and Effectiveness in Recommendation with Numerical Features via Learning to Contrast the Counterfactual samples

- **LLM Score**: 4

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03187v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-03 10:17:41
- **Comment**: Accepted by TheWebConf2024
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies, particularly in the area of recommender systems. However, it focuses more on interpretability and effectiveness in recommendation, which is a related but distinct area from your core interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> We propose a general model-agnostic Contrastive learning framework with
Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CCSS) for modeling the monotonicity
between the neural network output and numerical features which is critical for
interpretability and effectiveness of recommender systems. CCSS models the
monotonicity via a two-stage process: synthesizing counterfactual samples and
contrasting the counterfactual samples. The two techniques are naturally
integrated into a model-agnostic framework, forming an end-to-end training
process. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a publicly available dataset
and a real industrial dataset, and the results well demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed CCSS. Besides, CCSS has been deployed in our real
large-scale industrial recommender, successfully serving over hundreds of
millions users.

### 13. Domain Adaptation of LLMs for Process Data

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 1
- **Authors**: Rafael Seidi Oyamada, Jari Peeperkorn, Jochen De Weerdt, Johannes De Smedt
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03161v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-03 09:21:35
- **Topic Keywords**: search
- **Reason**: The paper explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Process Mining, which is a domain-specific area. While it touches on aspects of model adaptation and fine-tuning, it doesn't directly relate to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. The focus on process data and predictive process monitoring is somewhat relevant, but not a central match for the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

### 14. Knowledge graph-based personalized multimodal recommendation fusion framework

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 1
- **Authors**: Yu Fang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02943v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-03 02:17:28
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend
- **Reason**: The paper discusses a knowledge graph-based recommendation framework, which is somewhat related to information retrieval, but its focus on multimodal recommendation fusion and knowledge graphs is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> In the contemporary age characterized by information abundance, rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence have rendered recommendation systems
indispensable. Conventional recommendation methodologies based on collaborative
filtering or individual attributes encounter deficiencies in capturing nuanced
user interests. Knowledge graphs and multimodal data integration offer enhanced
representations of users and items with greater richness and precision. This
paper reviews existing multimodal knowledge graph recommendation frameworks,
identifying shortcomings in modal interaction and higher-order dependency
modeling. We propose the Cross-Graph Cross-Modal Mutual Information-Driven
Unified Knowledge Graph Learning and Recommendation Framework
(CrossGMMI-DUKGLR), which employs pre-trained visual-text alignment models for
feature extraction, achieves fine-grained modality fusion through multi-head
cross-attention, and propagates higher-order adjacency information via graph
attention networks.

### 15. IDEAlign: Comparing Large Language Models to Human Experts in Open-ended Interpretive Annotations

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,
interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or
generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text
annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives
(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether
LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is
challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of
similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable
evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied
task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing
expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task,
and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones
(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human
benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets
(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based
metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful
to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with
expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and
vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm
for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing
responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on Arabic Question-Answer Generation, which is not directly related to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While it involves some NLP aspects, the primary focus is on question generation and answer evaluation, rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

- **Topic Keywords**: rag, ctr
- **Reason**: This paper is not directly related to your primary research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While it involves the use of pre-trained Large Language Models, the focus is on symbolic regression and physics-informed modeling, which is not a central match to your research themes.

#### Abstract
> Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

- **Topic Keywords**: rag, rank, search
- **Reason**: This paper is not relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or Natural Language Processing. The focus is on speech multimodal models and pronunciation evaluation, which is outside your primary areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation
Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD)
simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our
fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or
separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks.
Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores
predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC
> 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER)
and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA
layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those
achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an
integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large
multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler
training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for
simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for
more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation
Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

While it touches on query-based conditional prediction, it's in the context of tabular tasks, which is not a primary area of interest for the user.

#### Abstract
> We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

- **Submitted**: 2025-09-03 13:42:14
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on Large Language Model (LLM) agentic systems and proposes a framework for attributing system failure. While it involves complex systems and deep semantic understanding, it is primarily concerned with LLMs and their applications, which is somewhat related to information retrieval but not a central match to your research interests.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple
models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially
outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their
fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific
agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the
task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning
LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy
generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first
automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via
counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated
dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a
lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning,
capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions.
On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs
like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard
in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers
actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS
with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving
agentic AI.

- **Reason**: This paper is not directly related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or Natural Language Processing. The focus is on evaluating Large Language Models for a specific low-resource language, Sinhala, which doesn't align with your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and
reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global
or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and
culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to
bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors
and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce
SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed
specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over
7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with
the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,
encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We
evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and
GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,
overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in
culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for
improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on Business Sentiment Analysis using LSTM and RNN models, which is a topic in NLP. However, it does not align with the user's primary research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and query understanding, making it only loosely relevant.

#### Abstract
> Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular
topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis
techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis
techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine
learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages
like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is
used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing
gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network
(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this
experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the
data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared
with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.
It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional
RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has
achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business
company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their
customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.
Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can
evaluate its marketing strategy.

While it involves NLP and machine learning, the context and application are quite different from the user's areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience
disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders
compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a
consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study
presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures
for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple
transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against
traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further
assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability
on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest
publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising
12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure
robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure
consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and
that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and
few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social
connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the
models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity
concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that
graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital
health interventions and public health policy.

#### Abstract
> Parallel to the development of advanced deepfake audio generation, audio
deepfake detection has also seen significant progress. However, a standardized

detection systems, currently across 14 diverse datasets and attack scenarios,
standardized evaluation metrics and protocols for reproducibility and
transparency. It also includes a leaderboard to compare and rank the systems to
help researchers and developers enhance their reliability and robustness. We
include 14 evaluation sets, 12 state-of-the-art open-source and 3 proprietary
detection systems. Our study presents many systems exhibiting high EER in
out-of-domain scenarios, highlighting the need for extensive cross-domain
evaluation. The leaderboard is hosted on Huggingface1 and a toolkit for

While it involves Natural Language Processing, the specific topic of adapter-based fine-tuning for large language models does not align with your core themes of query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and
limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It
proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable
mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural
sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of
adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This
allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to
match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,
the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction
of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly
improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the
paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically
evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data
perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and
robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language
understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks.
It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness
to noise and perturbation.

#### Abstract
> Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for
adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely
used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA,
PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with
limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive
integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further
introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates
input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors
fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain
adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We
evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including
child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All
implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future
work.

#### Abstract
> Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired
and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its
significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access
to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social
exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend
on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.
