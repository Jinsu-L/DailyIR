        "title": "Aligned Query Expansion: Efficient Query Expansion for Information Retrieval through LLM Alignment",
        "abstract": "With the breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), query generation\ntechniques that expand documents and queries with related terms are becoming\nincreasingly popular in the information retrieval field. Such techniques have\nbeen shown to improve the effectiveness of traditional lexical retrieval\nmethods by dealing with the vocabulary mismatch problem. Recent work has found\nthat generating queries with a greedy decoding strategy can produce sub-optimal\nqueries, including hallucinations, and proposed to filter out queries before\nexpansion. This `generate-then-filter' approach is costly, as it requires\ngenerating multiple queries and applying a relevance model to all of them and\ndoes not teach the LLM which of the generated queries is more effective for\nexpansion. To overcome such limitations, we propose Aligned Query Expansion\n(AQE), a novel approach to enhance query expansion for passage retrieval in\nopen-domain question answering. AQE leverages recent techniques in LLM\nalignment to fine-tune models for generating query expansions that directly\noptimize the effectiveness of the retrieval task, eliminating the need for\nadditional filtering steps. This alignment ensures that queries are more\nrelevant, reducing computational costs while improving retrieval effectiveness.\nEmpirical evaluations show that AQE outperforms baseline models for query\nexpansion in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrating\nsignificant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Understanding relationships between documents in large-scale corpora is\nessential for knowledge discovery and information organization. However,\nexisting approaches rely heavily on manual annotation or predefined\nrelationship taxonomies. We propose EDR-MQ (Extracting Document Relations by\nMarginalizing over User Queries), a novel framework that discovers document\nrelationships through query marginalization. EDR-MQ is based on the insight\nthat strongly related documents often co-occur in results across diverse user\nqueries, enabling us to estimate joint probabilities between document pairs by\nmarginalizing over a collection of queries. To enable this query\nmarginalization approach, we develop Multiply Conditioned Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (MC-RAG), which employs conditional retrieval where subsequent\ndocument retrievals depend on previously retrieved content. By observing\nco-occurrence patterns across diverse queries, EDR-MQ estimates joint\nprobabilities between document pairs without requiring labeled training data or\npredefined taxonomies. Experimental results show that our query marginalization\napproach successfully identifies meaningful document relationships, revealing\ntopical clusters, evidence chains, and cross-domain connections that are not\napparent through traditional similarity-based methods. Our query-driven\nframework offers a practical approach to document organization that adapts to\ndifferent user perspectives and information needs.",

        "abstract": "Effective management of Service Function Chains (SFCs) and optimal Virtual\nNetwork Function (VNF) placement are critical challenges in modern\nSoftware-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)\nenvironments. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely adopted for\ndynamic network decision-making, its inherent dependency on structured data and\nfixed action rules often limits adaptability and responsiveness, particularly\nunder unpredictable network conditions. This paper introduces LiLM-RDB-SFC, a\nnovel approach combining Lightweight Language Model (LiLM) with Relational\nDatabase (RDB) to answer network state queries to guide DRL model for efficient\nSFC provisioning. Our proposed approach leverages two LiLMs, Bidirectional and\nAuto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and the Fine-tuned Language Net T5\n(FLAN-T5), to interpret network data and support diverse query types related to\nSFC demands, data center resources, and VNF availability. Results demonstrate\nthat FLAN-T5 outperforms BART with a lower test loss (0.00161 compared to\n0.00734), higher accuracy (94.79% compared to 80.2%), and less processing time\n(2h 2min compared to 2h 38min).

Adult service\nwebsites (ASWs) have and continue to be linked to sex trafficking, offering a\nplatform for traffickers to advertise their victims. Thus, organizations\ninvolved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when\nattempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge\nin transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous\nresearch using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking\nads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of\nemojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement\nscrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for\nthis application area, including simple information retrieval methods,\npre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that\ncharacteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to\nbe trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for\ninference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned\nvariants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,\nRoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We\ndemonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks\nrelated to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph\nrepresentation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the\nlearned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context\nwe study.

        "abstract": "The growing volume of unstructured data within organizations poses\nsignificant challenges for data analysis and process automation. Unstructured\ndata, which lacks a predefined format, encompasses various forms such as\nemails, reports, and scans. It is estimated to constitute approximately 80% of\nenterprise data. Despite the valuable insights it can offer, extracting\nmeaningful information from unstructured data is more complex compared to\nstructured data. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has gained popularity for\nautomating repetitive tasks, improving efficiency, and reducing errors.\nHowever, RPA is traditionally reliant on structured data, limiting its\napplication to processes involving unstructured documents. This study addresses\nthis limitation by developing the UNstructured Document REtrieval SyStem\n(UNDRESS), a system that uses fuzzy regular expressions, techniques for natural\nlanguage processing, and large language models to enable RPA platforms to\neffectively retrieve information from unstructured documents. The research\ninvolved the design and development of a prototype system, and its subsequent\nevaluation based on text extraction and information retrieval performance.

The large\nlanguage model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts\npossess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our\nresearch integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to\naddress the limitations of novelty assessment. One of the most common types of\nnovelty in academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper,\nwe propose leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language\nmodels (PLMs, e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers.\nSpecifically, we extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper\nfrom peer review reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of\nthe academic paper, which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have\ndesigned a text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better\nintegrate human and LLM knowledge.

        "abstract": "As online news consumption grows, personalized recommendation systems have\nbecome integral to digital journalism. However, these systems risk reinforcing\nfilter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse\nperspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target --\ncan help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and\ndata-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research\nremains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address\nthese gaps, we introduce \\textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for\narticle-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with\narticle-level and 19,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal\nissues. We also propose \\textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \\textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided\n\\textbf{A}gentic \\textbf{I}n-\\textbf{C}ontext \\textbf{L}earning framework that\nemploys a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural\nsegments (e.g., leads, quotes), which are then aggregated to infer the overall\narticle stance. Experiments show that \\textsc{JoA-ICL} outperforms existing\nstance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in\ncapturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies\nfurther demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in\nnews recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource\nlanguages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as\nhomophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To\naddress this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel\nmeaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)\nframework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja\n(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja\ncandidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual\ndisambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation\nto prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge\nsignificantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\\% relative\nimprovement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment\nbetween Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive\ncross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, these gains persist even when Hanja\naugmentation is omitted at inference time, ensuring practical efficiency with\nno additional run-time cost.",

Previous work has attempted to\ncompare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that\nhave different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We\nintroduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and\ndecoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on\nup to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and\ndecoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their\nrespective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as\ndecoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at\nclassification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.\nHowever, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice\nversa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse\nobjective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa\nfor generative tasks).

        "abstract": "Verifying the credibility of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is essential for\nreliable cybersecurity defense. However, traditional approaches typically treat\nthis task as a static classification problem, relying on handcrafted features\nor isolated deep learning models. These methods often lack the robustness\nneeded to handle incomplete, heterogeneous, or noisy intelligence, and they\nprovide limited transparency in decision-making-factors that reduce their\neffectiveness in real-world threat environments. To address these limitations,\nwe propose LRCTI, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework designed for\nmulti-step CTI credibility verification. The framework first employs a text\nsummarization module to distill complex intelligence reports into concise and\nactionable threat claims. It then uses an adaptive multi-step evidence\nretrieval mechanism that iteratively identifies and refines supporting\ninformation from a CTI-specific corpus, guided by LLM feedback. Finally, a\nprompt-based Natural Language Inference (NLI) module is applied to evaluate the\ncredibility of each claim while generating interpretable justifications for the\nclassification outcome. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets,\nCTI-200 and PolitiFact show that LRCTI improves F1-Macro and F1-Micro scores by\nover 5%, reaching 90.9% and 93.6%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines. These results demonstrate that LRCTI effectively addresses the core\nlimitations of prior methods, offering a scalable, accurate, and explainable\nsolution for automated CTI credibility verification",

        "abstract": "The growing prevalence of cross-border financial activities in global markets\nhas underscored the necessity of accurately identifying and classifying foreign\nentities. This practice is essential within the Spanish financial system for\nensuring robust risk management, regulatory adherence, and the prevention of\nfinancial misconduct. This process involves a labor-intensive entity-matching\ntask, where entities need to be validated against available reference sources.\nChallenges arise from linguistic variations, special characters, outdated\nnames, and changes in legal forms, complicating traditional matching algorithms\nlike Jaccard, cosine, and Levenshtein distances. These methods struggle with\ncontextual nuances and semantic relationships, leading to mismatches. To\naddress these limitations, we explore Large Language Models (LLMs) as a\nflexible alternative. LLMs leverage extensive training to interpret context,\nhandle abbreviations, and adapt to legal transitions. We evaluate traditional\nmethods, Hugging Face-based LLMs, and interface-based LLMs (e.g., Microsoft\nCopilot, Alibaba's Qwen 2.5) using a dataset of 65 Portuguese company cases.\nResults show traditional methods achieve accuracies over 92% but suffer high\nfalse positive rates (20-40%). Interface-based LLMs outperform, achieving\naccuracies above 93%, F1 scores exceeding 96%, and lower false positives\n(40-80%).",

        "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing\nlarge language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and\ncomputational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of\nLlama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from\n51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.\nFurthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as\nGPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging\nW4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision\nbaselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

We specifically examined two central tenets of Walther's\n(2024) social approval theory of online hate: (H1a) more signals of social\napproval on hate messages predicts more subsequent hate messages, and (H1b) as\nsocial approval increases, hate speech messages become more extreme. Using over\n110 million posts from Parler (2018-2021), we observed that the number of\nupvotes a person received on a hate speech post was unassociated with the\namount of hate speech in their next post and posts during the next week, month,\nthree months, and six months. Between-person effects revealed an average\nnegative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the\npost level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social\napproval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on\nniche social media platforms.",

        "abstract": "Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly\nchallenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and\nmemory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable.\nNevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ\nfixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air\ntransmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address\nthis limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework\nfor communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank\nconfiguration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted\nprojections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential\ndecision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates\ncoarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic\ncomplexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models\n(DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The\ntwo modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the\nClassifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards.\nExperiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM\nconsistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing\ntransmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven,\ndiffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning\nover the air.",

While multi-agent\nsystems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over\nsingle-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental\nstudy of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding\naccuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source\nMAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and\nconsensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion\nparameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding\ndecisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from\nonline math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and\nwhen consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas\n(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus\nin four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,\nhigher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas\non consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust\nimprovements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS\nconsensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code\ncategory showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was\n0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive\npersona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations\nsuggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications\nthat could improve codebooks and human-AI coding. We contribute new insight\ninto the limits of LLM-based qualitative methods, challenging the notion that\ndiverse MAS personas lead to better outcomes. We open-source our MAS and\nexperimentation code.",

How well do these models\nalign with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research\nhas shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack\nrobust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the\ncurrent study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a\nfine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human\nperformance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in\nLLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity\nbetween the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity\nbetween the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the\neffectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we\nexamine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in\nhumans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and\nnot just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done).

        "abstract": "Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests\nbased on their behaviors or auxiliary signals. However, existing methods often\nrely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same\ninterest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with\nreal-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) show significant\npotential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and\npowerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the\ngranularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to\noverly fine or coarse interest grouping. Second, individual user analysis\nprovides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we\npropose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more\neffective recommendation. At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to\nflexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters,\nindicating their diverse and distinct interests. To alleviate the agnostic\ngeneration of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users'\ncollaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions,\nallowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's\nbehaviors using an alignment module. To alleviate the limited insights derived\nfrom individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose\naggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more\ncomprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. We formulate a max covering\nproblem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users'\nbehaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven\nmulti-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.\nExperiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting\nadaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training.\nComplementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive\nannotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on\nthree dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic\ndiversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction\nquality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on\nexpert annotations.

However, LLMs' judicial\nfairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs\nact as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite\nto ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we\nconstruct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a\nselection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop\nthree evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and\nintroduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across\nvarious labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive\ninconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring\nsevere LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more\npronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance\nlabels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency\ncorrelates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate\nbiases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence\nLLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit\nsignificant effects on judicial fairness. Accordingly, we introduce a publicly\navailable toolkit containing all datasets and code, designed to support future\nresearch in evaluating and improving LLM fairness.",

        "title": "Can Multimodal Foundation Models Understand Schematic Diagrams? An Empirical Study on Information-Seeking QA over Scientific Papers",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to\nevaluate the ability of models to interpret schematic diagrams within\nscientific literature. MISS-QA comprises 1,500 expert-annotated examples over\n465 scientific papers. In this benchmark, models are tasked with interpreting\nschematic diagrams that illustrate research overviews and answering\ncorresponding information-seeking questions based on the broader context of the\npaper. We assess the performance of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models,\nincluding o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL. We reveal a significant\nperformance gap between these models and human experts on MISS-QA. Our analysis\nof model performance on unanswerable questions and our detailed error analysis\nfurther highlight the strengths and limitations of current models, offering key\ninsights to enhance models in comprehending multimodal scientific literature.",
