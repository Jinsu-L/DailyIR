        "title": "Symmetry in language statistics shapes the geometry of model representations",
        "abstract": "Although learned representations underlie neural networks' success, their fundamental properties remain poorly understood. A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models.",

        "abstract": "Bio-pharmaceutical innovation has shifted: many new drug assets now originate outside the United States and are disclosed primarily via regional, non-English channels. Recent data suggests that over 85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total. A growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at 30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface \"under-the-radar\" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucination. We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real-deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. On this benchmark, our Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 score, outperforming Claude Opus 4.6 (56.2%), Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research (50.6%), OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro (46.6%), Perplexity Deep Research (44.2%), and Exa Websets (26.9%). Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results.",

        "title": "Scaling Beyond Masked Diffusion Language Models",
        "abstract": "Diffusion language models are a promising alternative to autoregressive models due to their potential for faster generation. Among discrete diffusion approaches, Masked diffusion currently dominates, largely driven by strong perplexity on language modeling benchmarks. In this work, we present the first scaling law study of uniform-state and interpolating discrete diffusion methods. We also show that Masked diffusion models can be made approximately 12% more FLOPs-efficient when trained with a simple cross-entropy objective. We find that perplexity is informative within a diffusion family but can be misleading across families, where models with worse likelihood scaling may be preferable due to faster and more practical sampling, as reflected by the speed-quality Pareto frontier. These results challenge the view that Masked diffusion is categorically the future of diffusion language modeling and that perplexity alone suffices for cross-algorithm comparison. Scaling all methods to 1.7B parameters, we show that uniform-state diffusion remains competitive on likelihood-based benchmarks and outperforms autoregressive and Masked diffusion models on GSM8K, despite worse validation perplexity.

Addressing the scarcity of parallel corpora that map between styles, the study employs roundtrip translation to synthesize such parallel datasets from monolingual corpora. This approach creates 'neutralized' text devoid of stylistic attributes, essentially creating a shared input style at training-time and inference-time. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority of this method over zero-shot prompting and fewshot ICL techniques measured by BLEU scores and style accuracy scores across four investigated domains. Furthermore, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for terminology and name knowledge enhances robustness and stylistic consistency.",

        "abstract": "Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.",

        "abstract": "News recommendation plays a critical role in online news platforms by helping users discover relevant content. Cross-domain news recommendation further requires inferring user's underlying information needs from heterogeneous signals that often extend beyond direct news consumption. A key challenge lies in moving beyond surface-level behaviors to capture deeper, reusable user interests while maintaining scalability in large-scale production systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models to generate high-quality lists of interest-driven news search queries from cross-domain user signals. We formulate query-list generation as a policy optimization problem and employ GRPO with multiple reward signals. We systematically study two compute dimensions: inference-time sampling and model capacity, and empirically observe consistent improvements with increased compute that exhibit scaling-like behavior. Finally, we perform on-policy distillation to transfer the learned policy from a large, compute-intensive teacher to a compact student model suitable for scalable deployment. Extensive offline experiments, ablation studies and large-scale online A/B tests in a production news recommendation system demonstrate consistent gains in both interest modeling quality and downstream recommendation performance.",

While LLMs offer unprecedented scalability and speed, their reliance on web-scale training data raises concerns regarding demographic and behavioral biases that may distort workforce assessment. We present a counterfactual fairness evaluation of LLM-based QA systems across 13 dimensions spanning three categories: Identity, Context, and Behavioral Style. Fairness is quantified using the Counterfactual Flip Rate (CFR), the frequency of binary judgment reversals, and the Mean Absolute Score Difference (MASD), the average shift in coaching or confidence scores across counterfactual pairs. Evaluating 18 LLMs on 3,000 real-world contact center transcripts, we find systematic disparities, with CFR ranging from 5.4% to 13.0% and consistent MASD shifts across confidence, positive, and improvement scores. Larger, more strongly aligned models show lower unfairness, though fairness does not track accuracy. Contextual priming of historical performance induces the most severe degradations (CFR up to 16.4%), while implicit linguistic identity cues remain a persistent bias source. Finally, we analyze the efficacy of fairness-aware prompting, finding that explicit instructions yield only modest improvements in evaluative consistency. Our findings underscore the need for standardized fairness auditing pipelines prior to deploying LLMs in high-stakes workforce evaluation.",

However, relying on these models introduces substantial computational and energy requirements, leading to increasing attention toward their environmental cost and the sustainability of large-scale deployments. While neural IR models deliver high retrieval effectiveness, their scalability is constrained in multi-domain scenarios, where training and maintaining domain-specific models is inefficient and achieving robust cross-domain generalisation within a unified model remains difficult. This paper introduces DRAMA (Domain Retrieval using Adaptive Module Allocation), an energy- and parameter-efficient framework designed to reduce the environmental footprint of neural retrieval. DRAMA integrates domain-specific adapter modules with a dynamic gating mechanism that selects the most relevant domain knowledge for each query. New domains can be added efficiently through lightweight adapter training, avoiding full model retraining. We evaluate DRAMA on multiple Web retrieval benchmarks covering different domains. Our extensive evaluation shows that DRAMA achieves comparable effectiveness to domain-specific models while using only a fraction of their parameters and computational resources. These findings show that energy-aware model design can significantly improve scalability and sustainability in neural IR.",

Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reference-based plan evaluation framework operating in two modes - a metric-wise evaluator spanning seven dimensions (e.g., tool-prompt alignment, query adherence) and a one-shot evaluator; (ii) a data curation methodology that iteratively refines plans via an evaluator->optimizer loop to produce high-quality plan lineages (ordered plan revisions) while reducing manual effort; and (iii) a large-scale study of 14 LLMs across sizes and families for their ability to decompose queries into step-by-step, executable, and tool-assigned plans, evaluated under prompts with and without lineage. Empirically, LLMs struggle on compound queries and on plans exceeding 4 steps (typically 5-15); the best total metric score reaches 84.8% (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), while the strongest one-shot match rate at the \"A+\" tier (Extremely Good, Very Good) is only 49.75% (o3-mini). Plan lineage yields mixed gains overall but benefits several top models and improves step executability for many. Our results highlight persistent gaps in tool-understanding, especially in tool-prompt alignment and tool-usage completeness, and show that shorter, simpler plans are markedly easier. The framework and findings provide a reproducible path for assessing and improving agentic planning with tools for answering data-analysis queries in contact-center settings.",

In this paper, we propose BFS-PO, an RL algorithm which alleviates this problem using a Best-First Search exploration strategy. Specifically, BFS-PO looks for the shortest correct answer using a backtracking mechanism based on maximum entropy nodes. By generating progressively shorter responses during training, BFS-PO learns to produce concise reasoning chains. Using different benchmarks and base LRMs, we show that BFS-PO can simultaneously increase the LRM accuracy and shorten its answers.",

Self-Normalised Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) is a standard tool for variance reduction in OPE, leveraging a multiplicative control variate. Recent advances in off-policy learning suggest that additive control variates (baseline corrections) may offer superior performance, yet theoretical guarantees for evaluation are lacking. This paper provides a definitive answer: we prove that $β^\\star$-IPS, an estimator with an optimal additive baseline, asymptotically dominates SNIPS in Mean Squared Error. By analytically decomposing the variance gap, we show that SNIPS is asymptotically equivalent to using a specific -- but generally sub-optimal -- additive baseline.

However, these are often sequence-to-sequence tasks: learning to map actions (permutations) to states, which is incompatible with the next-token prediction setting commonly used to train language models. We address this gap by converting permutation composition into code via REPL traces that interleave state-reveals through prints and variable transformations. We show that linear RNNs capable of state-tracking excel also in this setting, while Transformers still fail. Motivated by this representation, we investigate why tracking states in code is generally difficult: actions are not always fully observable. We frame this as tracking the state of a probabilistic finite-state automaton with deterministic state reveals and show that linear RNNs can be worse than non-linear RNNs at tracking states in this setup.",

Recent years have witnessed growing interest in reasoning tasks within Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, no prior research has examined the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on non-question-answering (non-QA) physical commonsense reasoning tasks in low-resource languages such as Basque. Taking the Italian GITA as a starting point, this paper addresses this gap by presenting BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, available in both standard and dialectal variants. We evaluate model performance across three hierarchical levels of commonsense understanding: (1) distinguishing between plausible and implausible narratives (accuracy), (2) identifying the conflicting element that renders a narrative implausible (consistency), and (3) determining the specific physical state that creates the implausibility (verifiability). These tasks were assessed using multiple multilingual LLMs as well as models pretrained specifically for Italian and Basque. Results indicate that, in terms of verifiability, LLMs exhibit limited physical commonsense capabilities in low-resource languages such as Basque, especially when processing dialectal variants.",

        "abstract": "Tool-using LLM agents increasingly coordinate real workloads by selecting and chaining third-party tools based on text-visible metadata such as tool names, descriptions, and return messages. We show that this convenience creates a supply-chain attack surface: a malicious MCP tool server can be co-registered alongside normal tools and induce overthinking loops, where individually trivial or plausible tool calls compose into cyclic trajectories that inflate end-to-end tokens and latency without any single step looking abnormal. We formalize this as a structural overthinking attack, distinguishable from token-level verbosity, and implement 14 malicious tools across three servers that trigger repetition, forced refinement, and distraction. Across heterogeneous registries and multiple tool-capable models, the attack causes severe resource amplification (up to $142.4\\times$ tokens) and can degrade task outcomes. Finally, we find that decoding-time concision controls do not reliably prevent loop induction, suggesting defenses should reason about tool-call structure rather than tokens alone.",

        "abstract": "Breaking long documents into smaller segments is a fundamental challenge in information retrieval. Whether for search engines, question-answering systems, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), effective segmentation determines how well systems can locate and return relevant information. However, traditional methods, such as fixed-length or coherence-based segmentation, ignore user intent, leading to chunks that split answers or contain irrelevant noise. We introduce Intent-Driven Dynamic Chunking (IDC), a novel approach that uses predicted user queries to guide document segmentation. IDC leverages a Large Language Model to generate likely user intents for a document and then employs a dynamic programming algorithm to find the globally optimal chunk boundaries. This represents a novel application of DP to intent-aware segmentation that avoids greedy pitfalls. We evaluated IDC on six diverse question-answering datasets, including news articles, Wikipedia, academic papers, and technical documentation. IDC outperformed traditional chunking strategies on five datasets, improving top-1 retrieval accuracy by 5% to 67%, and matched the best baseline on the sixth. Additionally, IDC produced 40-60% fewer chunks than baseline methods while achieving 93-100% answer coverage. These results demonstrate that aligning document structure with anticipated information needs significantly boosts retrieval performance, particularly for long and heterogeneous documents.",

Moreover, research has shown that LLMs possess behavioral self-awareness - the ability to describe learned behaviors that were only implicitly demonstrated in training data. Here, we investigate the intersection of these phenomena. We fine-tune GPT-4.1 models sequentially on datasets known to induce and reverse emergent misalignment and evaluate whether the models are self-aware of their behavior transitions without providing in-context examples. Our results show that emergently misaligned models rate themselves as significantly more harmful compared to their base model and realigned counterparts, demonstrating behavioral self-awareness of their own emergent misalignment. Our findings show that behavioral self-awareness tracks actual alignment states of models, indicating that models can be queried for informative signals about their own safety.",

        "abstract": "Reasoning-oriented large language models (RLMs) achieve strong gains on tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating explicit intermediate reasoning. However, their impact on machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate several open- and closed-weights RLMs on the WMT24++ benchmark and find that enabling explicit reasoning consistently degrades translation quality across languages and models. Analysis reveals that MT reasoning traces are highly linear, lacking revision, self-correction and exploration of alternative translations, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, injecting higher-quality reasoning traces from stronger models does not reliably improve weaker models' performance. To address this mismatch, we propose a structured reasoning framework tailored to translation, based on multi-step drafting, adequacy refinement, fluency improvement, and selective iterative revision. We curate a synthetic dataset of dynamic structured reasoning traces and post-train a large reasoning model on this data. Experiments show significant improvements over standard translation fine-tuning and injected generic reasoning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning must be task-structured to benefit MT.",

This creates a subtle misalignment: residual connections tie activations to the current token, while supervision targets the next token, potentially propagating mismatched information if the current token is not the most informative for prediction. In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that these strategies alleviate the representation misalignment and yield improvements, providing an efficient and general architectural enhancement for autoregressive Transformers.",

Controlled vocabularies provide a promising basis for measuring relatedness and are widely used in combination with Salton's cosine similarity. The latter is problematic because it only considers exact matches between terms. This article introduces two alternative methods - soft cosine and maximum term similarities - that account for the semantic similarity between non-matching terms. The article compares the accuracy of all three methods using the assignment of publications to topics in the TREC 2006 Genomics Track and the assumption that accurate relatedness measures should assign high relatedness scores to publication pairs within the same topic and low scores to pairs from separate topics. Results show that soft cosine is the most accurate method, while the most widely used version of Salton's cosine is markedly less accurate than the other methods tested. These findings have implications for how controlled vocabularies should be used to measure relatedness.",

        "abstract": "Attitudes toward STEM develop from the interaction of conceptual knowledge, educational experiences, and affect. Here we use cognitive network science to reconstruct group mindsets as behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMNs). In this case, nodes are cue words and free associations, edges are empirical associative links, and each concept is annotated with perceived valence. We analyse BFMNs from N = 994 observations spanning high school students, university students, and early-career STEM experts, alongside LLM (GPT-oss) \"digital twins\" prompted to emulate comparable profiles. Focusing also on semantic neighbourhoods (\"frames\") around key target concepts (e.g., STEM subjects or educational actors/places), we quantify frames in terms of valence auras, emotional profiles, network overlap (Jaccard similarity), and concreteness relative to null baselines. Across student groups, science and research are consistently framed positively, while their core quantitative subjects (mathematics and statistics) exhibit more negative and anxiety related auras, amplified in higher math-anxiety subgroups, evidencing a STEM-science cognitive and emotional dissonance. High-anxiety frames are also less concrete than chance, suggesting more abstract and decontextualised representations of threatening quantitative domains. Human networks show greater overlapping between mathematics and anxiety than GPT-oss. The results highlight how BFMNs capture cognitive-affective signatures of mindsets towards the target domains and indicate that LLM-based digital twins approximate cultural attitudes but miss key context-sensitive, experience-based components relevant to replicate human educational anxiety.",

While closed-source models typically rely on external defenses, open-weight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameter-level manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is crucial for delaying its progression. While AI-based speech detection is non-invasive and cost-effective, it faces a critical data efficiency dilemma due to medical data scarcity and privacy barriers. Therefore, we propose FAL-AD, a novel framework that synergistically integrates federated learning with data augmentation to systematically optimize data efficiency. Our approach delivers three key breakthroughs: First, absolute efficiency improvement through voice conversion-based augmentation, which generates diverse pathological speech samples via cross-category voice-content recombination. Second, collaborative efficiency breakthrough via an adaptive federated learning paradigm, maximizing cross-institutional benefits under privacy constraints. Finally, representational efficiency optimization by an attentive cross-modal fusion model, which achieves fine-grained word-level alignment and acoustic-textual interaction. Evaluated on ADReSSo, FAL-AD achieves a state-of-the-art multi-modal accuracy of 91.52%, outperforming all centralized baselines and demonstrating a practical solution to the data efficiency dilemma.

        "abstract": "The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis posits that speakers are subject to a communicative pressure to distribute information evenly within utterances, minimising surprisal variance. While this hypothesis has been tested empirically, prior studies are limited exclusively to text-only inputs, abstracting away from the perceptual context in which utterances are produced. In this work, we present the first computational study of UID in visually grounded settings. We estimate surprisal using multilingual vision-and-language models over image-caption data in 30 languages and visual storytelling data in 13 languages, together spanning 11 families. We find that grounding on perception consistently smooths the distribution of information, increasing both global and local uniformity across typologically diverse languages compared to text-only settings. In visual narratives, grounding in both image and discourse contexts has additional effects, with the strongest surprisal reductions occurring at the onset of discourse units. Overall, this study takes a first step towards modelling the temporal dynamics of information flow in ecologically plausible, multimodal language use, and finds that grounded language exhibits greater information uniformity, supporting a context-sensitive formulation of UID.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, but their high computational costs limit their practical deployment. Recent studies reveal significant redundancy in LLMs layers, making layer pruning an active research topic. Layer pruning research primarily focuses on two aspects: measuring layer importance and recovering performance after pruning. Unfortunately, the present works fail to simultaneously maintain pruning performance and efficiency. In this study, we propose GradMAP, a faster layer pruning method with \\textbf{Grad}ient \\textbf{M}etric \\textbf{A}nd \\textbf{P}rojection compensation, which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we introduce a novel metric based on gradient magnitudes, enabling a global assessment of layer importance. Note that, it requires only a single backward propagation step per pruning decision, substantially enhancing pruning efficiency. In the second stage, we first analyze the layers with the largest mean shift resulting from pruning, and then incorporate a simple yet effective projection compensation matrix to correct this drift in one step. In this way, the degradation of model performance caused by layer pruning is effectively alleviated. Extensive experiments show that GradMAP outperforms previous layer pruning methods in both pruning speed (achieving an average $4\\times$ speedup) and performance.",

To bridge this gap, we propose Alignment Adapter (AlAd): a lightweight, sliding-window-based adapter. It aligns the token-level embeddings of a compressed model with those of the original large model. AlAd preserves local contextual semantics, enables flexible alignment across differing dimensionalities or architectures, and is entirely agnostic to the underlying compression method. AlAd can be deployed in two ways: as a plug-and-play module over a frozen compressed model, or by jointly fine-tuning AlAd with the compressed model for further performance gains. Through experiments on BERT-family models across three token-level NLP tasks, we demonstrate that AlAd significantly boosts the performance of compressed models with only marginal overhead in size and latency.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen remarkable advancements, achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse applications. Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning. Our work highlights the importance of token-level dataset optimization, and demonstrates the potential of strategies based on attribute decomposition for explaining complex training mechanisms.",

We examine this fundamental question by evaluating whether LLMs genuinely reason mathematically in these languages or depend on implicit translation to English-like representations. Using a taxonomy of six math problem types, from basic arithmetic to complex unit conflict and optimization problems, we evaluate four prominent large language models. To avoid translation artifacts that confound language ability with translation quality, we construct a parallel dataset where each problem is natively authored by fluent speakers with mathematical training in all three languages. Our analysis demonstrates that while basic arithmetic reasoning transfers robustly across languages, complex reasoning tasks show significant degradation in Tamil and Sinhala. The pattern of failures varies by model and problem type, suggesting that apparent multilingual competence may not reflect uniform reasoning capabilities across languages. These findings challenge the common assumption that models exhibiting strong multilingual performance can reason equally effectively across languages, and highlight the need for fine-grained, type-aware evaluation in multilingual settings.",

Incorporating these enriched signals into ranking models mitigates cold-start effects and improves relevance and competitiveness. Experiments on a large E-commerce platform, both offline and online, show that BFS significantly improves search relevance and product discovery for cold-start products.

        "abstract": "Industrial-scale user representation learning requires balancing robust universality with acute task-sensitivity. However, existing paradigms primarily yield static, task-agnostic embeddings that struggle to reconcile the divergent requirements of downstream scenarios within unified vector spaces. Furthermore, heterogeneous multi-source data introduces inherent noise and modality conflicts, degrading representation. We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment. Large-scale online A/B testing in Alipay's production system across two real-world scenarios further validates its practical effectiveness.

However, existing PEFT methods mainly operate in Euclidean space, fundamentally limiting their capacity to capture complex geometric structures inherent in language data. While alternative geometric spaces, like hyperbolic geometries for hierarchical data and spherical manifolds for circular patterns, offer theoretical advantages, forcing representations into a single manifold type ultimately limits expressiveness, even when curvature parameters are learnable. To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations. Building on this scheme, we develop MoSLoRA, which extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with heterogeneous geometric experts, enabling models to dynamically select or combine appropriate geometric spaces based on input context. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead of frequent manifold switching, we develop a lightweight routing mechanism. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how curvature optimization impacts training stability and model performance. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoSLoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 5.6% improvement on MATH500 and 15.9% on MAWPS.",

        "title": "HyperRAG: Reasoning N-ary Facts over Hypergraphs for Retrieval Augmented Generation",
        "abstract": "Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, typically built on knowledge graphs (KGs) with binary relational facts, have shown promise in multi-hop open-domain QA. However, their rigid retrieval schemes and dense similarity search often introduce irrelevant context, increase computational overhead, and limit relational expressiveness. In contrast, n-ary hypergraphs encode higher-order relational facts that capture richer inter-entity dependencies and enable shallower, more efficient reasoning paths. To address this limitation, we propose HyperRAG, a RAG framework tailored for n-ary hypergraphs with two complementary retrieval variants: (i) HyperRetriever learns structural-semantic reasoning over n-ary facts to construct query-conditioned relational chains. It enables accurate factual tracking, adaptive high-order traversal, and interpretable multi-hop reasoning under context constraints. (ii) HyperMemory leverages the LLM's parametric memory to guide beam search, dynamically scoring n-ary facts and entities for query-aware path expansion. Extensive evaluations on WikiTopics (11 closed-domain datasets) and three open-domain QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) validate HyperRAG's effectiveness. HyperRetriever achieves the highest answer accuracy overall, with average gains of 2.95% in MRR and 1.23% in Hits@10 over the strongest baseline. Qualitative analysis further shows that HyperRetriever bridges reasoning gaps through adaptive and interpretable n-ary chain construction, benefiting both open and closed-domain QA.",

        "abstract": "Reverse Chain-of-Thought Generation (RCG) synthesizes reasoning traces from query-answer pairs, but runs the risk of producing post-hoc rationalizations: when models can see the answer during generation, the answer serves as a cognitive anchor that shapes the entire explanation. We formalize this phenomenon through a three-level measurement hierarchy: lexical, entropic, and probabilistic anchoring, each captures surface artifacts, entropy dynamics, and latent answer dependence, respectively. We analyze semantic suppression, the intuitive mitigation strategy that instructs models to ignore the answer, to find out its counterproduction: while it reduces lexical overlap, it paradoxically increases entropic and probabilistic anchoring. Drawing on Ironic Process Theory from cognitive psychology, we attribute this failure to active monitoring of the forbidden answer, which inadvertently deepens dependence on it. To break this cycle, we propose Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning (SSR), a two-phase approach that first generates an answer-invariant functional skeleton structure, then uses this skeleton to guide full trace generation. By redirecting the information flow to structural planning rather than answer monitoring, SSR consistently reduces anchoring across all three levels. We further introduce Distilled SSR (SSR-D), which fine-tunes models on teacher-generated SSR traces to ensure reliable structural adherence. Experiments across open-ended reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SSR-D achieves up to 10% improvement over suppression baselines while preserving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.",

We expand the linguistic scope of BBQ and construct FilBBQ through a four-phase development process consisting of template categorization, culturally aware translation, new template construction, and prompt generation. These processes resulted in a bias test composed of more than 10,000 prompts which assess whether models demonstrate sexist and homophobic prejudices relevant to the Philippine context. We then apply FilBBQ on models trained in Filipino but do so with a robust evaluation protocol that improves upon the reliability and accuracy of previous BBQ implementations. Specifically, we account for models' response instability by obtaining prompt responses across multiple seeds and averaging the bias scores calculated from these distinctly seeded runs. Our results confirm both the variability of bias scores across different seeds and the presence of sexist and homophobic biases relating to emotion, domesticity, stereotyped queer interests, and polygamy.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R\\&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R\\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI.

Inspired by human reasoning patterns where people solve new problems by leveraging past related cases to constrain search spaces and reduce trial-and-error, we propose Precedent Informed Reasoning (PIR) transforming LRMs'reasoning paradigm from exhaustive self-exploration to guided learning from precedents. PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.",

We propose Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator derived from the steady-state solution of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block. Analysis of the synchronization matrices reveals non-uniform, head-diverse coupling patterns even at initialization, demonstrating a stronger architectural inductive bias than the approximately uniform attention produced by randomly initialized Transformers.",

Each persona is defined by demographic attributes (age group, gender, income, education, reading level), behavioral patterns (books per year, genre preferences, discovery methods, price sensitivity), and consistency parameters. Panels are composed per imprint to reflect target demographics, with diversity constraints ensuring representation across age, reading level, and genre affinity. Book concepts compete in single-elimination, double-elimination, round-robin, or Swiss-system tournaments, judged against weighted criteria including market appeal, originality, and execution potential. To reject low-quality LLM evaluations, we implement five automated anti-slop checks (repetitive phrasing, generic framing, circular reasoning, score clustering, audience mismatch). We report results from deployment within a multi-imprint publishing operation managing 6 active imprints and 609 titles in distribution. Three case studies -- a 270-evaluator panel for a children's literacy novel, and two 5-person expert panels for a military memoir and a naval strategy monograph -- demonstrate that synthetic panels produce actionable demographic segmentation, identify structural content issues invisible to homogeneous reviewers, and enable tournament filtering that eliminates low-quality concepts while enriching high-quality survivors from 15% to 62% of the evaluated pool.",

Existing compression and distillation techniques are largely designed for static graphs; directly applying them to temporal settings may overlook time-dependent interactions and lead to performance degradation. We propose an LLM-assisted distillation framework specifically designed for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Beyond a conventional high-capacity temporal teacher, we incorporate a large language model as an auxiliary instructor to provide enriched supervision. The LLM supplies broad background knowledge and temporally informed signals, enabling a lightweight student to better model event dynamics without increasing inference-time complexity. Training is conducted by jointly optimizing supervised and distillation objectives, using a staged alignment strategy to progressively integrate guidance from both teachers. Extensive experiments on multiple public TKG benchmarks with diverse backbone architectures demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently improves link prediction performance over strong distillation baselines, while maintaining a compact and efficient student model. The results highlight the potential of large language models as effective teachers for transferring temporal reasoning capability to resource-efficient TKG systems.",

The embedding space functions as a conditional expectation over a σ-algebra, and its failure to be isomorphic to the semantic truth set fundamentally causes logical consistency breakdown. WavePhaseNet Method The authors propose WavePhaseNet, which explicitly constructs a Semantic Conceptual Hierarchy Structure (SCHS) using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). By applying DFT along the sequence dimension, semantic information is decomposed into frequency bands: low-frequency components capture global meaning and intent, while high-frequency components represent local syntax and expression. This staged separation enables precise semantic manipulation in diagonalized space. Dimensionality Reduction GPT-4's 24,576-dimensional embedding space exhibits a 1/f spectral structure based on language self-similarity and Zipf's law. Through cumulative energy analysis, the authors derive that approximately 3,000 dimensions constitute the lower bound for \"complete representation.\" This demonstrates that reduction from 24,576 to 3,000 dimensions preserves meaning and intent while enabling rigorous reasoning and suppressing hallucination. Cohomological Consistency Control The reduced embedding space, constructed via cohomological regularization over overlapping local windows, allows defining a graph structure and cochain complex. This quantifies inconsistencies among local inferences as coboundary-based losses. Applying harmonic projection based on Hodge theory positions cohomology as a computable regularization principle for controlling semantic consistency, extracting maximally consistent global representations.",

While effective for many generation tasks, such an approach may not fully capture the structure of complex reasoning tasks, where a single semantic decision is often realized across multiple tokens--for example, when defining variables or composing equations. This introduces a potential mismatch between token-level optimization and the inherently block-level nature of reasoning in these settings. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-token Policy Gradient Optimization (MPO), a framework that treats sequences of K consecutive tokens as unified semantic actions. This block-level perspective enables our method to capture the compositional structure of reasoning trajectories and supports optimization over coherent, higher-level objectives. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks show that MPO outperforms standard token-level policy gradient baselines, highlight the limitations of token-level policy gradients for complex reasoning, motivating future research to look beyond token-level granularity for reasoning-intensive language tasks.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a widely used framework for reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific tasks by retrieving relevant documents from a database to support accurate responses. However, when the database contains sensitive corpora, such as medical records or legal documents, RAG poses serious privacy risks by potentially exposing private information through its outputs. Prior work has demonstrated that one can practically craft adversarial prompts that force an LLM to regurgitate the augmented contexts. A promising direction is to integrate differential privacy (DP), a privacy notion that offers strong formal guarantees, into RAG systems. However, naively applying DP mechanisms into existing systems often leads to significant utility degradation. Particularly for RAG systems, DP can reduce the usefulness of the augmented contexts leading to increase risk of hallucination from the LLMs. Motivated by these challenges, we present DP-KSA, a novel privacy-preserving RAG algorithm that integrates DP using the propose-test-release paradigm. DP-KSA follows from a key observation that most question-answering (QA) queries can be sufficiently answered with a few keywords. Hence, DP-KSA first obtains an ensemble of relevant contexts, each of which will be used to generate a response from an LLM. We utilize these responses to obtain the most frequent keywords in a differentially private manner. Lastly, the keywords are augmented into the prompt for the final output. This approach effectively compresses the semantic space while preserving both utility and privacy. We formally show that DP-KSA provides formal DP guarantees on the generated output with respect to the RAG database. We evaluate DP-KSA on two QA benchmarks using three instruction-tuned LLMs, and our empirical results demonstrate that DP-KSA achieves a strong privacy-utility tradeoff.",

To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics. We construct comprehensive datasets derived from authoritative peer-reviewed submissions to benchmark InnoEval. Experiments demonstrate that InnoEval can consistently outperform baselines in point-wise, pair-wise, and group-wise evaluation tasks, exhibiting judgment patterns and consensus highly aligned with human experts.",

        "abstract": "Airbnb search must balance a worldwide, highly varied supply of homes with guests whose location, amenity, style, and price expectations differ widely. Meeting those expectations hinges on an efficient retrieval stage that surfaces only the listings a guest might realistically book, before resource intensive ranking models are applied to determine the best results. Unlike many recommendation engines, our system faces a distinctive challenge, location retrieval, that sits upstream of ranking and determines which geographic areas are queried in order to filter inventory to a candidate set. The preexisting approach employs a deep bayesian bandit based system to predict a rectangular retrieval bounds area that can be used for filtering. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the methodology, challenges, and impact of rearchitecting search to retrieve from the subset of most bookable high precision rectangular map cells defined by dividing the world into 25M uniform cells.",

        "abstract": "We construct a concept-object knowledge graph from the full astro-ph corpus through July 2025. Using an automated pipeline, we extract named astrophysical objects from OCR-processed papers, resolve them to SIMBAD identifiers, and link them to scientific concepts annotated in the source corpus. We then test whether historical graph structure can forecast new concept-object associations before they appear in print. Because the concepts are derived from clustering and therefore overlap semantically, we apply an inference-time concept-similarity smoothing step uniformly to all methods. Across four temporal cutoffs on a physically meaningful subset of concepts, an implicit-feedback matrix factorization model (alternating least squares, ALS) with smoothing outperforms the strongest neighborhood baseline (KNN using text-embedding concept similarity) by 16.8% on NDCG@100 (0.144 vs 0.123) and 19.8% on Recall@100 (0.175 vs 0.146), and exceeds the best recency heuristic by 96% and 88%, respectively. These results indicate that historical literature encodes predictive structure not captured by global heuristics or local neighborhood voting, suggesting a path toward tools that could help triage follow-up targets for scarce telescope time.",

        "title": "Does Socialization Emerge in AI Agent Society? A Case Study of Moltbook",
        "abstract": "As large language model agents increasingly populate networked environments, a fundamental question arises: do artificial intelligence (AI) agent societies undergo convergence dynamics similar to human social systems? Lately, Moltbook approximates a plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies.",

        "title": "FMMD: A multimodal open peer review dataset based on F1000Research",
        "abstract": "Automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) has entered the coexistence phase with traditional peer review, where artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly incorporated into real-world manuscript evaluation. In parallel, research on automated and AI-assisted peer review has proliferated. Despite this momentum, empirical progress remains constrained by several critical limitations in existing datasets. While reviewers routinely evaluate figures, tables, and complex layouts to assess scientific claims, most existing datasets remain overwhelmingly text-centric. This bias is reinforced by a narrow focus on data from computer science venues. Furthermore, these datasets lack precise alignment between reviewer comments and specific manuscript versions, obscuring the iterative relationship between peer review and manuscript evolution. In response, we introduce FMMD, a multimodal and multidisciplinary open peer review dataset curated from F1000Research. The dataset bridges the current gap by integrating manuscript-level visual and structural data with version-specific reviewer reports and editorial decisions. By providing explicit alignment between reviewer comments and the exact article iteration under review, FMMD enables fine-grained analysis of the peer review lifecycle across diverse scientific domains. FMMD supports tasks such as multimodal issue detection and multimodal review comment generation. It provides a comprehensive empirical resource for the development of peer review research.",

        "title": "MCPShield: A Security Cognition Layer for Adaptive Trust Calibration in Model Context Protocol Agents",
        "abstract": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes tool use for LLM-based agents and enable third-party servers. This openness introduces a security misalignment: agents implicitly trust tools exposed by potentially untrusted MCP servers. However, despite its excellent utility, existing agents typically offer limited validation for third-party MCP servers. As a result, agents remain vulnerable to MCP-based attacks that exploit the misalignment between agents and servers throughout the tool invocation lifecycle. In this paper, we propose MCPShield as a plug-in security cognition layer that mitigates this misalignment and ensures agent security when invoking MCP-based tools. Drawing inspiration from human experience-driven tool validation, MCPShield assists agent forms security cognition with metadata-guided probing before invocation. Our method constrains execution within controlled boundaries while cognizing runtime events, and subsequently updates security cognition by reasoning over historical traces after invocation, building on human post-use reflection on tool behavior. Experiments demonstrate that MCPShield exhibits strong generalization in defending against six novel MCP-based attack scenarios across six widely used agentic LLMs, while avoiding false positives on benign servers and incurring low deployment overhead. Overall, our work provides a practical and robust security safeguard for MCP-based tool invocation in open agent ecosystems.",

        "title": "Whom to Query for What: Adaptive Group Elicitation via Multi-Turn LLM Interactions",
        "abstract": "Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about latent group-level properties from surveys and other collective assessments requires allocating limited questioning effort under real costs and missing data. Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.",
