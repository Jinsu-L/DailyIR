        "abstract": "The rapid evolution of e-commerce has exposed the limitations of traditional\nproduct retrieval systems in managing complex, multi-turn user interactions.\nRecent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those\nleveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown\npromise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios\nand struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn\ndialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as\na powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance\nthrough iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically\nrelies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical\nreasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are\nrarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are\noften ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding\nresponses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose\na novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational\nmultimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever,\nfurther augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves\nretrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent\nthroughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent\nimprovements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in\nnDCG@1.",

        "abstract": "As queries in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines powered by large\nlanguage models (LLMs) become increasingly complex and diverse, dense retrieval\nmodels have demonstrated strong performance in semantic matching. Nevertheless,\nthey often struggle with fine-grained retrieval tasks, where precise keyword\nalignment and span-level localization are required, even in cases with high\nlexical overlap that would intuitively suggest easier retrieval. To\nsystematically evaluate this limitation, we introduce two targeted tasks,\nkeyword retrieval and part-of-passage retrieval, designed to simulate practical\nfine-grained scenarios. Motivated by these observations, we propose\nLexSemBridge, a unified framework that enhances dense query representations\nthrough fine-grained, input-aware vector modulation. LexSemBridge constructs\nlatent enhancement vectors from input tokens using three paradigms: Statistical\n(SLR), Learned (LLR), and Contextual (CLR), and integrates them with dense\nembeddings via element-wise interaction. Theoretically, we show that this\nmodulation preserves the semantic direction while selectively amplifying\ndiscriminative dimensions. LexSemBridge operates as a plug-in without modifying\nthe backbone encoder and naturally extends to both text and vision modalities.\nExtensive experiments across semantic and fine-grained retrieval tasks validate\nthe effectiveness and generality of our approach.

While existing methods\nexcel at estimating users' broad interests based on the filtered historical\nbehaviors, they typically under-exploit explicit alignment between a user's\nreal-time intent (represented by the user query) and their past actions. In\nthis paper, we propose DiffusionGS, a novel and scalable approach powered by\ngenerative models. Our key insight is that user queries can serve as explicit\nintent anchors to facilitate the extraction of users' immediate interests from\nlong-term, noisy historical behaviors. Specifically, we formulate interest\nextraction as a conditional denoising task, where the user's query guides a\nconditional diffusion process to produce a robust, user intent-aware\nrepresentation from their behavioral sequence. We propose the User-aware\nDenoising Layer (UDL) to incorporate user-specific profiles into the\noptimization of attention distribution on the user's past actions. By reframing\nqueries as intent priors and leveraging diffusion-based denoising, our method\nprovides a powerful mechanism for capturing dynamic user interest shifts.\nExtensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nDiffusionGS over state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "In large-scale recommender systems, ultra-long user behavior sequences encode\nrich signals of evolving interests. Extending sequence length generally\nimproves accuracy, but directly modeling such sequences in production is\ninfeasible due to latency and memory constraints. Existing solutions fall into\ntwo categories: (1) top-k retrieval, which truncates the sequence and may\ndiscard most attention mass when L >> k; and (2) encoder-based compression,\nwhich preserves coverage but often over-compresses and fails to incorporate key\ncontext such as temporal gaps or target-aware signals. Neither class achieves a\ngood balance of low-loss compression, context awareness, and efficiency.\n  We propose VQL, a context-aware Vector Quantization Attention framework for\nultra-long behavior modeling, with three innovations. (1) Key-only\nquantization: only attention keys are quantized, while values remain intact; we\nprove that softmax normalization yields an error bound independent of sequence\nlength, and a codebook loss directly supervises quantization quality. This also\nenables L-free inference via offline caches. (2) Multi-scale quantization:\nattention heads are partitioned into groups, each with its own small codebook,\nwhich reduces quantization error while keeping cache size fixed. (3) Efficient\ncontext injection: static features (e.g., item category, modality) are directly\nintegrated, and relative position is modeled via a separable temporal kernel.\nAll context is injected without enlarging the codebook, so cached\nrepresentations remain query-independent.\n  Experiments on three large-scale datasets (KuaiRand-1K, KuaiRec, TMALL) show\nthat VQL consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy\nwhile reducing inference latency, establishing a new state of the art in\nbalancing accuracy and efficiency for ultra-long sequence recommendation.",

Our\nlinguistic analysis reveals that LLM-generated texts exhibit smoother\nhigh-frequency and steeper low-frequency Zipf slopes, higher term specificity,\nand greater document-level diversity. These traits are aligned with LLMs being\ntrained to optimize reader experience through diverse and precise expressions.\nOur study further explores whether term-based retrieval models demonstrate\nsource bias, concluding that these models prioritize documents whose term\ndistributions closely correspond to those of the queries, rather than\ndisplaying an inherent source bias. This work provides a foundation for\nunderstanding and addressing potential biases in term-based IR systems managing\nmixed-source content.",

A Large Language Model\n(LLM) is used to create query variants: alternative queries that have the same\nmeaning as the original. These variants represent user profiles characterised\nby different properties, such as language and domain proficiency, which are\nknown in the IR literature to influence query formulation.\n  The LLM's ability to generate query variants that align with user profiles is\nempirically validated, and the variants' utility is further explored for IR\nsystem evaluation. Results demonstrate that the variants impact how systems are\nranked and show that user profiles experience significantly different levels of\nsystem effectiveness. This method enables an alternative perspective on system\nevaluation where we can observe both the impact of user profiles on system\nrankings and how system performance varies across users.",

        "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time\nscaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1\nintegrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning\nprocesses but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating\nunstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a\nresult, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the\nreasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical\nquestion-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical\nrequirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain\nInference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time\nscalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over\nstructured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex\nqueries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference\nchains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop\ntraversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve\ncontradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k,\nCMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o,\nTree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both\nautomatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability\nby generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to\nconcrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex\nmedical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely recognized paradigm\nto combine parametric memory with non-parametric memories. An RAG model\nconsists of two serial connecting components (retriever and generator). A major\nchallenge in end-to-end optimization of the RAG model is that marginalization\nover relevant passages (modeled as discrete latent variables) from a knowledge\nbase is required. Traditional top-K marginalization and variational RAG (VRAG)\nsuffer from biased or high-variance gradient estimates. In this paper, we\npropose and develop joint stochastic approximation (JSA) based end-to-end\ntraining of RAG, which is referred to as JSA-RAG. The JSA algorithm is a\nstochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and is\nparticularly powerful in estimating discrete latent variable models. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on five datasets for two tasks (open-domain question\nanswering, knowledge-grounded dialogs) and show that JSA-RAG significantly\noutperforms both vanilla RAG and VRAG. Further analysis shows the efficacy of\nJSA-RAG from the perspectives of generation, retrieval, and low-variance\ngradient estimate.",

Yet, they rely on additional models\nor services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and\noften requiring the model to process a large number of tokens.

Our approach uses\nconstrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a\nKnowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a\nprefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external\nknowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows\nonly sequences of tokens that form an existing fact.

We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook\nRepresentations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for\nimproved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings\nfrom app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns\ndiscrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel --\nunlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables\nindependent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better\nmodeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative\nsignals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item\nlevels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a\ndual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to\ncapture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a\nlarge-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong\nbaselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps.

        "abstract": "User simulation is increasingly vital to develop and evaluate recommender\nsystems (RSs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to\nsimulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain\nalignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale\nsimulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is\nthe extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such\nfeedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is\noften ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference\nalignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the\nefficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering\nmechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we\nintroduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in\nRSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data.\nOur framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate\ncognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing\nambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty\nestimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation\nsamples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using\nsuch high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes.\nExtensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the\nalignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of\nfine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when\ninteracting with RSs.

Furthermore, we argue for an unlearning setup that\nreflects the sequential, time-sensitive nature of real-world deletion requests.\nWe also present a preliminary experiment in a next-basket recommendation\nsetting based on our proposed desiderata and find that unlearning also works\nfor sequential recommendation models, exposed to many small unlearning\nrequests. In this case, we observe that a modification of a custom-designed\nunlearning algorithm for recommender systems outperforms general unlearning\nalgorithms significantly, and that unlearning can be executed with a latency of\nonly several seconds.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to generate responses that are faithful to the retrieved context.\nHowever, faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge, as existing\nmethods often require costly supervision and post-training or significant\ninference burdens. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised\nFaithfulness Optimization (SSFO), the first self-supervised alignment approach\nfor enhancing RAG faithfulness. SSFO constructs preference data pairs by\ncontrasting the model's outputs generated with and without the context.\nLeveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO aligns model faithfulness\nwithout incurring labeling costs or additional inference burden. We\ntheoretically and empirically demonstrate that SSFO leverages a benign form of\n\\emph{likelihood displacement}, transferring probability mass from\nparametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Based on this insight, we\npropose a modified DPO loss function to encourage likelihood displacement.\nComprehensive evaluations show that SSFO significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based\nquestion-answering datasets. Notably, SSFO exhibits strong generalization,\nimproving cross-lingual faithfulness and preserving general\ninstruction-following capabilities.

To\nautomate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,\nmethods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured\nones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like\nNL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of\nsemi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To\nthis end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured\ntable question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the\nHierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures\ncomplex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for\nconstructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables.

Specifically, we leverage\ntext-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing\neach target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract\nmultiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are\ncompiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a\nshallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. After which, any recognized\nvariant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription.\nThe evaluation results on the Librispeech dataset show that our method reduces\nbiased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while\nmaintaining unbiased WER essentially unchanged.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the\nindividual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can\ndegrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length\nand content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient\nexploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence\nstage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning\nstage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing\nincreased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating\noverthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage,\ndefined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the\nend of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the\nLLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking\ntoken (e.g., \\texttt{</think>}), though these methods lack an efficient and\nprecise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP\npatterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic\nrules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D)\ndemonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving\nor enhancing reasoning accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their\nhistorical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted\nsignificant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user\ninterest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising\nGaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models\nface two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the\ncondition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian\nnoise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting\npractical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet\neffective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to\nexplicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future\ninterests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers\ngreater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient\nsampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior\ndistribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user\npreference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation\nobjective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both\npositive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation\nquality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the\nsuperiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.",

Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism\ntension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with\nlimited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often\nskew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically\ndifferent paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a\nstatic benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models\nasynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community\nverification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions\nsourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi\nand history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and\nbrowsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are\noften hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them\nyields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset\nand its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human\nreview to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2)\nUQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the\ngenerator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate\nsolutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts\ncollectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation\non only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already\nidentified correct answers among those that passed.

In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a\nself-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a\ntree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and\nfixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant\nadditional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and\npruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update\ncompute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key\ncontributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates\nthe KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along\nwith an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage\nestimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.\nand (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic\ndivergence and fallback strategy.

        "abstract": "Interactive online learning environments, represented by Massive AI-empowered\nCourses (MAIC), leverage LLM-driven multi-agent systems to transform passive\nMOOCs into dynamic, text-based platforms, enhancing interactivity through LLMs.\nThis paper conducts an empirical study on a specific MAIC course to explore\nthree research questions about dropouts in these interactive online courses:\n(1) What factors might lead to dropouts? (2) Can we predict dropouts? (3) Can\nwe reduce dropouts? We analyze interaction logs to define dropouts and identify\ncontributing factors. Our findings reveal strong links between dropout\nbehaviors and textual interaction patterns. We then propose a\ncourse-progress-adaptive dropout prediction framework (CPADP) to predict\ndropouts with at most 95.4% accuracy. Based on this, we design a personalized\nemail recall agent to re-engage at-risk students. Applied in the deployed MAIC\nsystem with over 3,000 students, the feasibility and effectiveness of our\napproach have been validated on students with diverse backgrounds.",

        "abstract": "The pursuit of human-level artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly\nadvanced the development of autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs).\nLLMs are now widely utilized as decision-making agents for their ability to\ninterpret instructions, manage sequential tasks, and adapt through feedback.\nThis review examines recent developments in employing LLMs as autonomous agents\nand tool users and comprises seven research questions. We only used the papers\npublished between 2023 and 2025 in conferences of the A* and A rank and Q1\njournals. A structured analysis of the LLM agents' architectural design\nprinciples, dividing their applications into single-agent and multi-agent\nsystems, and strategies for integrating external tools is presented. In\naddition, the cognitive mechanisms of LLM, including reasoning, planning, and\nmemory, and the impact of prompting methods and fine-tuning procedures on agent\nperformance are also investigated. Furthermore, we evaluated current benchmarks\nand assessment protocols and have provided an analysis of 68 publicly available\ndatasets to assess the performance of LLM-based agents in various tasks. In\nconducting this review, we have identified critical findings on verifiable\nreasoning of LLMs, the capacity for self-improvement, and the personalization\nof LLM-based agents. Finally, we have discussed ten future research directions\nto overcome these gaps.",

While many works have focused\non improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping\nnon-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores\nthe problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First,\nwe construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation\ntask, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an\nevaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which\nencompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this,\nwe conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and\nlegal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of\nthe current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the\nneed for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further\nexploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly\navailable.",
