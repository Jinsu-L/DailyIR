        "abstract": "We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI\nautomation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web\nplatforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element\nGrounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills\nfor GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)\nmetric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.\nThrough MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical\ndeterminant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of\nmodular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,\nto achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and\ncross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad\naction space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,\ntask efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models\nsuffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even\nwhen tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,\neffective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable\ntruly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation\ndata, and running environment will be publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/open-compass/MMBench-GUI.",

        "title": "Advancing Event Forecasting through Massive Training of Large Language Models: Challenges, Solutions, and Broader Impacts",
        "abstract": "Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast\ndoubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved\nevaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching\nsuperforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been\nreported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how\nthese technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to\nsociety in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths\nand considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,\naiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.",

        "title": "Let It Go? Not Quite: Addressing Item Cold Start in Sequential Recommendations with Content-Based Initialization",
        "abstract": "Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where\nitems with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due\nto the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage\nitem metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use\nembeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as\ninitialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content\nembeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt\nto the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can\ndegrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far\nfrom their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to\naddress this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or\nfine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen\nembeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting\nthem go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach\ndemonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities,\nincluding e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset\nwith audio-based representation.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via\nreinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue\nthat the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer\nlearning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,\nscalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt\noptimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn\nhigh-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or\nmore LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool\ncalls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose\nproblems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons\nfrom the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it\ncan often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four\ntasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up\nto 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,\nMIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an\ninference-time search strategy for code optimization.",

        "abstract": "Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare\napplications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information\nretrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two\ncritical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of\nmedical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of\nmethodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and\nsemantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often\ninadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full\nspectrum of real world medical tasks.\n  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned\non diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across\nmultiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.\n  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks\nspanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled\non the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of\nmedical text.

We evaluated our ADE\nRC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities\n(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on\ndetecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged\nF1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences\nfor the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best\nperforming model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and\n0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best\nin our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using\npredicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs\nwere detected.

        "abstract": "Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear\ncomputational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to\nself-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic\ncomplexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope\nour method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further\nprogress, we will release code and dataset.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.\nHowever, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e.,\nlow-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is\ncritical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have\nequipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing\nthem to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by\nthis ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that\nexplicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming\nto enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We\nvalidate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the\nretriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA\ndatasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG\nperformance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,\nwhere the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,\nwhere it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently\nimproves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can\nalso effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that\nincorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for\nbuilding more robust RAG systems.

        "abstract": "Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are\ntrained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While\nempirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple\nobjective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work\nintroduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to\ndeconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the\nsingle-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category\nStoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,\nallows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes\nthree main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic\nrationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,\nquantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods\nexploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn\nnot just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a\nprocess we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we\nprove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive\nlearning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,\nwe show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align\nwith the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a\ngeometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs.

To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in\nwhether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up\nstrategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent\nself-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a\nlexicon.

To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily\ncomputer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15\napplications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and\na generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by\nincorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized\nrelevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In\ncontrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the\nusefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical\nevidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high\ncomputational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of\npassages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries\nrequiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to\ndistill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient\nmodels. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,\nenabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the\nneed for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer\ngeneration and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window\nmethod that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution\nfor RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer\nquality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher\nmodel for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into\nRankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex\nquestions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in\nenhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking\nand utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting\nfurther research in this area.",

In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel\nregularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in\ngraph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional\ntraining objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,\nthereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more\npersonalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive\n(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the\ncontribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We\nfurther explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed\npopularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach\nflexible and adaptive.

Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as\ndemonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU)\nand Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even\nenhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics.

In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model\nthat incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy\nannotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic\ndisagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at\nrecovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than\ntraditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how\ndifferences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam\naffect the performance of our model.

        "abstract": "AI-based Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have significant potential to\ntransform teaching and learning. As efforts continue to design, develop, and\nintegrate ITS into educational contexts, mixed results about their\neffectiveness have emerged. This paper provides a comprehensive review to\nunderstand how ITS operate in real educational settings and to identify the\nassociated challenges in their application and evaluation. We use a systematic\nliterature review method to analyze numerous qualified studies published from\n2010 to 2025, examining domains such as pedagogical strategies, NLP, adaptive\nlearning, student modeling, and domain-specific applications of ITS. The\nresults reveal a complex landscape regarding the effectiveness of ITS,\nhighlighting both advancements and persistent challenges. The study also\nidentifies a need for greater scientific rigor in experimental design and data\nanalysis. Based on these findings, suggestions for future research and\npractical implications are proposed.",

        "abstract": "Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a\nconversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language\nprocessing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by\nnarrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the\ncode-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the\nsignificance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this\ncontext remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating\ncode-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from\nseven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating\nsynthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.\nOur analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets\ninvolving multiple language families.

We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family:\nfour RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its\nspecific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script\nfeatures and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by\ngeneral-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa\nvariants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points.

        "abstract": "Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are widely used in recommender systems\nthat require continuous, incremental learning. A core aspect of MABs is the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to\nbe enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear\nbandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the\nsame linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration\nstrategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is\nincreasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration\nbehavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of\nseveral linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy\nlinear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier\nperformance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This\nobservation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which\nconsistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that\npure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.\nOur results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for\nbandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory\nefficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for\ndeveloping more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations\ninto alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender\nsystems.",

SSC\nemploys a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a\nresponse based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,\nand then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole.
