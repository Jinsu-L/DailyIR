        "title": "On The Role of Pretrained Language Models in General-Purpose Text Embeddings: A Survey",
        "abstract": "Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness\nacross a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as\nretrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With\nthe emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text\nembeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce\nrich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically\nleverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized\nthrough contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey,\nwe provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the\nroles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental\narchitecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding\nextraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives,\nand data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such\nas multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and\nscenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research\ndirections that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking\nintegration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information\nincorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to\nserve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers\nseeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.",

We analyze the impact of adapting different weight\nmatrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity\nand memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA) fine-tuning.\n  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more\nsignificantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower\nperplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)\nHigher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns\nat higher ranks.\n  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance\nand privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for\ndeveloping more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large\nlanguage models while managing data privacy concerns.",

We also introduce ProjBench, a\nbenchmark that avoids leaked imports and consists of large-scale real-world\nprojects.\n  Experiments on ProjBench and CrossCodeEval show that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by\n22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%.

        "abstract": "Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world\nNLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse\nhuman perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and\ncostly, the emerging \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm sheds light on a promising\napproach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,\nto date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona\ndescriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are\nnot generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose\nMAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically\nconstruct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant\ntext documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the\npersonas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate\nmulti-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational\nand medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results\nthat better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional\nautomated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.",

In this paper, we describe our\nsolutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism\nIdentification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask\n1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address\neach subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck\nModel (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a\nfine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as\nhuman-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained\nexplanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also\ninvestigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,\ncan be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data\naugmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for\nEnglish in the Soft-Soft evaluation.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph\nCompletion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as\nblack-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC\nmethods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of\nerroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and\ndecisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural\ninformation with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of\nLLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge.\nWe propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first\nleverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural\ninformation into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction\nalgorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)\nthat needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format\ncomprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing\nmainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

We analyze how these tasks\ndiffer by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals.

By synthesizing pseudo-items\nand corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for\ninjection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference\nmodeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and\nstructural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the\nsuperiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with\nmaximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5\nover selected baselines.",

In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task\nembeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL\nprompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by\nsoftly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using\npre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.\nThis method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt\ndemonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while\nreducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive\nevaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model\nfamilies of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method\noutperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.2%-14.3% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show\nthat our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant\nroles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected\nby our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --\nunderscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality.

However,\nthis emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges. First, the\nsubstantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise\nurgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection. Second, their\npowerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce\nmisleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. To address these concerns,\nwe explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding\nimperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain\ndetectable by specialized algorithms. We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking\nframework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models. Waltz\nis inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are\nrarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold\ntokens''. Leveraging this insight, Waltz embeds watermarks by rewiring the\nsimilarity statistics between patch embeddings and cold token embeddings, and\ndetects watermarks using similarity z-scores. To minimize potential side\neffects, we introduce a similarity-based embedding position identification\nstrategy and employ projected gradient descent to constrain the watermark noise\nwithin a defined boundary. Extensive experiments using two popular LLMTS models\nacross seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Waltz achieves high watermark\ndetection accuracy with minimal impact on the quality of the generated time\nseries.",

Although existing faithfulness evaluation approaches\nhave shown promise, they are predominantly English-focused and often require\nexpensive human-labeled training data for fine-tuning specialized models. As\nLLMs see increased adoption in multilingual contexts, there is a need for\naccurate faithfulness evaluators that can operate across languages without\nextensive labeled data. This paper presents Self-Taught Evaluators for\nMultilingual Faithfulness, a framework that learns exclusively from synthetic\nmultilingual summarization data while leveraging cross-lingual transfer\nlearning. Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language\nfine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an\nLLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific\nevaluation tasks.

We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on\nthe X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity\ncategories. Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R\nand mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo)\nusing both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. Surprisingly, we find that\nXLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B\nparameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of\n16.9%.

Users often require varied and highly customizable\npolicies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.\nConsequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies\nand adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing\nfine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,\nrestricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive\nretraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited\ncontext lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies\ncomprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's\njudgment on \"precedents\", which are the reasoning processes of prior data\npoints similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed\npolicies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the\nguardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for\ncollecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents\nfor robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios\nand exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.",

While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks\nhave emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language\nunderstanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches\noften rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating\nnatural language into formal logic representations.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based\nJoint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework\nfor converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL).

To rigorously evaluate the\nNL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework\ncomprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and\nSpearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical\ntranslation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.\n  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA\nachieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational\noverhead compared to larger LLM-based systems.

Temporal motifs have\nbeen used to analyze social networks, financial transactions, and biological\nnetworks.\n  Motif counting in temporal graphs is particularly challenging.

        "title": "Automating Thematic Review of Prevention of Future Deaths Reports: Replicating the ONS Child Suicide Study using Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and\nWales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life. Analysis of\nthese reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to\nidentify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics\n(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\\leq$\n18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process\nbased entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully\nautomated, open source \"text-to-table\" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)\ncould reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide\nPFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD\nreports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD\nToolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases\nwhere the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or\nyounger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern\nsub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72\nchild-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded\nclinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the\nchild-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the\nLLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's\n$\\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script\nruntime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one\nthat can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis\ncan reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial\ndata, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health\nand safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.",

        "abstract": "We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32\nbillion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the\nMuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to\naddress training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of\nMuon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero\nloss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training\nprocess, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a\njoint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its\ncapabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.\n  Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking\nmodels, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on\nTau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on\nSWE-Bench Multilingual -- surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in\nnon-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding,\nmathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6,\n49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without\nextended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable\nopen-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering\nand agentic tasks. We release our base and post-trained model checkpoints to\nfacilitate future research and applications of agentic intelligence.",

As the industry expands to meet\nrising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks,\ninefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies,\nand critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water\nquality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant\nprogress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the\ndomain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nAQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed\nto support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this\neffort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic\nFramework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a\ncombination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated\nevaluation techniques.

        "abstract": "Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a basic task in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP). The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending\nresearch topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in\nthe development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks\nand datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public\nleaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed\nfor investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of\nlinguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available\nEnglish, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on\ntheir diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We\npresent a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting\ntheir strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth\nerror analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted\nthat there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a\nstandard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we\nformulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the\nevaluation diagnostics benchmarks: \"Why do not we have an evaluation standard\nfor the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?\" similar to ISO standard in\nindustry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered\nlinguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy\nfor linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for\ndiagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing\nthe results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.",
