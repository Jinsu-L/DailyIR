        "abstract": "Financial disclosures such as 10-K filings present challenging retrieval\nproblems due to their length, regulatory section hierarchy, and domain-specific\nlanguage, which standard retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models underuse.\nWe introduce FinGEAR (Financial Mapping-Guided Enhanced Answer Retrieval), a\nretrieval framework tailored to financial documents. FinGEAR combines a finance\nlexicon for Item-level guidance (FLAM), dual hierarchical indices for\nwithin-Item search (Summary Tree and Question Tree), and a two-stage\ncross-encoder reranker. This design aligns retrieval with disclosure structure\nand terminology, enabling fine-grained, query-aware context selection.\nEvaluated on full 10-Ks with queries aligned to the FinQA dataset, FinGEAR\ndelivers consistent gains in precision, recall, F1, and relevancy, improving F1\nby up to 56.7% over flat RAG, 12.5% over graph-based RAGs, and 217.6% over\nprior tree-based systems, while also increasing downstream answer accuracy with\na fixed reader. By jointly modeling section hierarchy and domain lexicon\nsignals, FinGEAR improves retrieval fidelity and provides a practical\nfoundation for high-stakes financial analysis.",

We apply\nMillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to\narguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs\nagree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether\nthese arguments are the same for different LLMs.\n  In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues.

A\ncommon approach is to replace the target word with a candidate in the original\nsentence and feed the modified sentence into a model to capture semantic\ndifferences before and after substitution. However, effectively modeling the\nbidirectional influence of candidate substitution on both the target word and\nits context remains challenging. Existing methods often focus solely on\nsemantic changes at the target position or rely on parameter tuning over\nmultiple evaluation metrics, making it difficult to accurately characterize\nsemantic variation. To address this, we investigate two approaches: one based\non attention weights and another leveraging the more interpretable integrated\ngradients method, both designed to measure the influence of context tokens on\nthe target token and to rank candidates by incorporating semantic similarity\nbetween the original and substituted sentences. Experiments on the LS07 and\nSWORDS datasets demonstrate that both approaches improve ranking performance.",

Existing methods employ\nretrieval-augmented generation to fill knowledge gaps, but they suffer from\nissues such as insufficient credibility of retrieved content and interference\nfrom noisy information. We propose a dynamic knowledge update-driven model for\nfake news detection (DYNAMO), which leverages knowledge graphs to achieve\ncontinuous updating of new knowledge and integrates with large language models\nto fulfill dual functions: news authenticity detection and verification of new\nknowledge correctness, solving the two key problems of ensuring the\nauthenticity of new knowledge and deeply mining news semantics. Specifically,\nwe first construct a news-domain-specific knowledge graph. Then, we use Monte\nCarlo Tree Search to decompose complex news and verify them step by step.\nFinally, we extract and update new knowledge from verified real news texts and\nreasoning paths. Experimental results demonstrate that DYNAMO achieves the best\nperformance on two real-world datasets.",

        "abstract": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a critical role in\napplications such as search engines, recommender systems, and RAG for LLMs.\nVector quantization (VQ), a crucial technique for ANNS, is commonly used to\nreduce space overhead and accelerate distance computations. However, despite\nsignificant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face\nchallenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve\naccuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically\npartition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By\nprioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates\nmore bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space\nquota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize\ndimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error.\nTo speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first\nquantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized\nvectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive\nenumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical\nmethods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ,\nExtended RabitQ). SAQ achieves up to 80% reduction in quantization error and\naccelerates encoding speed by over 80x compared to Extended RabitQ.",

        "abstract": "With many endangered languages at risk of disappearing, efforts to preserve\nthem now rely more than ever on using technology alongside culturally informed\nteaching strategies. This study examines user behaviors in TALKA, a generative\nAI-powered chatbot designed for Hakka language engagement, by employing a\ndual-layered analytical framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy of cognitive\nprocesses and dialogue act categorization. We analyzed 7,077 user utterances,\neach carefully annotated according to six cognitive levels and eleven dialogue\nact types. These included a variety of functions, such as asking for\ninformation, requesting translations, making cultural inquiries, and using\nlanguage creatively. Pragmatic classifications further highlight how different\ntypes of dialogue acts--such as feedback, control commands, and social\ngreetings--align with specific cognitive intentions. The results suggest that\ngenerative AI chatbots can support language learning in meaningful\nways--especially when they are designed with an understanding of how users\nthink and communicate. They may also help learners express themselves more\nconfidently and connect with their cultural identity. The TALKA case provides\nempirical insights into how AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive\ndevelopment in low-resource language learners, as well as pragmatic negotiation\nand socio-cultural affiliation. By focusing on AI-assisted language learning,\nthis study offers new insights into how technology can support language\npreservation and educational practice.",

        "title": "AEFS: Adaptive Early Feature Selection for Deep Recommender Systems",
        "abstract": "Feature selection has emerged as a crucial technique in refining recommender\nsystems. Recent advancements leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has\ndrawn significant attention, particularly in two main categories: early feature\nselection and late feature selection, differentiated by whether the selection\noccurs before or after the embedding layer. The early feature selection selects\na fixed subset of features and retrains the model, while the late feature\nselection, known as adaptive feature selection, dynamically adjusts feature\nchoices for each data instance, recognizing the variability in feature\nsignificance. Although adaptive feature selection has shown remarkable\nimprovements in performance, its main drawback lies in its post-embedding layer\nfeature selection. This process often becomes cumbersome and inefficient in\nlarge-scale recommender systems with billions of ID-type features, leading to a\nhighly sparse and parameter-heavy embedding layer. To overcome this, we\nintroduce Adaptive Early Feature Selection (AEFS), a very simple method that\nnot only adaptively selects informative features for each instance, but also\nsignificantly reduces the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS\nemploys a dual-model architecture, encompassing an auxiliary model dedicated to\nfeature selection and a main model responsible for prediction. To ensure\neffective alignment between these two models, we incorporate two collaborative\ntraining loss constraints. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark\ndatasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Notably,\nAEFS matches the performance of current state-of-theart Adaptive Late Feature\nSelection methods while achieving a significant reduction of 37. 5% in the\nactivated parameters of the embedding layer.

Traditional metrics like precision and recall often fail to account\nfor the inherent variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent\nassessments of AI performance. Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's\nKappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability. We introduce Relative\nPrecision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) - a new\nevaluation metrics that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions\nrather than a single reference. By normalizing performance against inter-expert\ndisagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the\nquality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of\ndiagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result.\nOur evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a\nlimited list when evaluating a given case. Instead, both the models being\ntested and the examiners verifying them arrive at a free-form diagnosis. In\nthis automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical\ndiagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable. We evaluate our\napproach using 360 medical dialogues, comparing multiple large language models\n(LLMs) against a panel of physicians. Large-scale study shows that\ntop-performing models, such as DeepSeek-V3, achieve consistency on par with or\nexceeding expert consensus. Moreover, we demonstrate that expert judgments\nexhibit significant variability - often greater than that between AI and\nhumans.

MALLM offers more than 144\nunique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert,\nPersonality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3)\ndiscussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g.,\nVoting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate.\nFurthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro,\nWinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD\nconfigurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window\ninto the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its\ncomponents and their interplay.",

        "abstract": "The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial\nsystems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological\nstructures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for\nlearning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a\nsimple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable\nembeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under\nspecific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a\nEuclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the\nrepresentation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a\nproperty we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of\nEuclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our\nmodel in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like\nstructures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our\nhypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the\nimproved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences.",

To address this challenge,\nwe propose a new VRM \\textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection\nbased on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for\nreinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning\ndata by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs,\nenabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns.

First, we evaluate semantic information\npreservation by analyzing changes in k-nearest neighbor relationships between\nimage representations, before and after projection. Second, we directly measure\ninformation loss by reconstructing visual embeddings from the projected\nrepresentation, localizing loss at an image patch level. Experiments reveal\nthat connectors substantially distort the local geometry of visual\nrepresentations, with k-nearest neighbors diverging by 40--60\\%\npost-projection, correlating with degradation in retrieval performance.

        "abstract": "Although large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their\npractical application is often hindered by the generation of non-factual\ncontent, which is called \"hallucination\". Ensuring the reliability of LLMs'\noutputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as\nfinance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination\ndetection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics.\nLeveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of\nLLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the\nsemantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic\ndepth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we\npropose \\textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)},\na training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1)\n\\textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of\ntoken representations within each layer; and (2) \\textbf{Inter-Layer Drift},\nwhich tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across\nlayers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather\nthan noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention\nsignals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of\nrepresentation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and\nlightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across\nfive open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that\nD$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.",

Despite these advancements,\nAI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection\nattacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability.

Towards this, we introduce Light Latent-space Decoding (L2D), an\neffective and efficient latent-space decoding method. L2D represents\nuser-preferred items by using the hidden states of test sequences reflecting\nthe LLM's internal thought, and obtains candidate item representations from the\nhidden states of training sequences labeled with the corresponding candidate\nitems.

However, the extent to which\nthis high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from\na Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as\nLLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a\ndataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians\npursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate\nand compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the\nfine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice\nquestion-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12\nmedical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including\nmedgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific\nprompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient\nfine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it\nutilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS:\nmedgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of\ncorrect answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion\nparameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results\n<50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all\nLLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters\nacross various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and\nresearch that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those\nexhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties\nshould utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.",

In this work, we investigate the problem of continually\nadding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining\ndata in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address\nthis problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank\nAdapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of\nthe model frozen. LayRA builds on two insights: (1) LoRA reduces forgetting,\nand (2) multilingual models encode inputs in the source language in the initial\nlayers, reason in English in intermediate layers, and translate back to the\nsource language in final layers. We experiment with adding multiple\ncombinations of Galician, Swahili, and Urdu to pretrained language models and\nevaluate each method on diverse multilingual tasks. We find that LayRA provides\nthe overall best tradeoff between preserving models' capabilities in previously\nsupported languages, while being competitive with existing approaches such as\nLoRA in learning new languages. We also demonstrate that using model\narithmetic, the adapted models can be equipped with strong instruction\nfollowing abilities without access to any instruction tuning data in the target\nlanguages.",

        "abstract": "In the era of large language model, relation extraction (RE) plays an\nimportant role in information extraction through the transformation of\nunstructured raw text into structured data (Wadhwa et al., 2023). In this\npaper, we systematically compare the performance of deep supervised learning\napproaches without transformers and those with transformers. We used a series\nof non-transformer architectures such as PA-LSTM(Zhang et al., 2017),\nC-GCN(Zhang et al., 2018), and AGGCN(attention guide GCN)(Guo et al., 2019),\nand a series of transformer architectures such as BERT, RoBERTa, and R-BERT(Wu\nand He, 2019). Our comparison included traditional metrics like micro F1, as\nwell as evaluations in different scenarios, varying sentence lengths, and\ndifferent percentages of the dataset for training. Our experiments were\nconducted on TACRED, TACREV, and RE-TACRED. The results show that\ntransformer-based models outperform non-transformer models, achieving micro F1\nscores of 80-90% compared to 64-67% for non-transformer models. Additionally,\nwe briefly review the research journey in supervised relation classification\nand discuss the role and current status of large language models (LLMs) in\nrelation extraction.",
