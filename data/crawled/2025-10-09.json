        "abstract": "Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency\nof compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of\nlossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the\nMulti-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of\nartificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the\nTransformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module\ntermed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses\nout-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To\nvalidate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like\narchitectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive\nexperiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate\nthat AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and\nachieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while\nsubstantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance,\naugmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5%\nand memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k\nsequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed vibe coding, where users leverage\nLLMs to generate and iteratively refine code through natural language\ninteractions until it passes their vibe check. Vibe check is tied to real-world\nhuman preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right,\nread cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code\nevaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness,\noverlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this\npaper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece\nunderlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides\nfunctional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following\ncapabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30\nverifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic\nverifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites,\nresulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following\nand functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even\nthe strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit\nclear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional\ncorrectness and instruction following correlates the best with human\npreference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on\nreal-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe\ncheck, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that\nbetter align with user preferences in coding.",

These\nlimitations significantly degrade the user experience for non-English speakers\nand hinder the global deployment of LRMs. To address these limitations, we\npropose M-Thinker, which is trained by the GRPO algorithm that involves a\nLanguage Consistency (LC) reward and a novel Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment\n(CTA) reward. Specifically, the LC reward defines a strict constraint on the\nlanguage consistency between the input, thought, and answer. Besides, the CTA\nreward compares the model's non-English reasoning paths with its English\nreasoning path to transfer its own reasoning capability from English to\nnon-English languages.

To address this gap, we introduce\nAudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and\ninference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set\nof tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations\nranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of\n2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech,\nsound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference.

We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs\nof token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across\ncurrent LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and\nmemory-efficient architectures.

When instructions\nprovide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about\npotential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to\nimprove response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction.\nThe empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various\napplications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing on\nmoral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsic\nself-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; and\nprovide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on our\nexperimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism of\nconvergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral\nconcepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the\nactivated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds. This paper\ndemonstrates the strong potential of moral self-correction by showing that it\nexhibits a desirable property of converged performance.",

PA-Tool enables small models to approach state-of-the-art\nperformance while maintaining computational efficiency for adaptation to new\ntools without retraining.

However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing\nstructural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at\ninference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context. This\noften results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for\nmulti-page reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a\nnovel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs\na symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page\ndependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more\nholistic representation of the document. During inference, an LLM agent\ndynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively\nretrieve the necessary evidence based on the query. Experiments on\nMMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG\nimproves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any\ntop-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at\ncomparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.",

While recent advances in large multilingual models like OpenAI's\nWhisper offer promising pathways for low-resource ASR development, critical\nquestions persist regarding practical deployment requirements. This paper\naddresses two fundamental concerns for practitioners: determining the minimum\ndata volumes needed for viable performance and characterizing the primary\nfailure modes that emerge in production systems. We evaluate Whisper's\nperformance through comprehensive experiments on two Bantu languages:\nsystematic data scaling analysis on Kinyarwanda using training sets from 1 to\n1,400 hours, and detailed error characterization on Kikuyu using 270 hours of\ntraining data. Our scaling experiments demonstrate that practical ASR\nperformance (WER < 13\\%) becomes achievable with as little as 50 hours of\ntraining data, with substantial improvements continuing through 200 hours (WER\n< 10\\%). Complementing these volume-focused findings, our error analysis\nreveals that data quality issues, particularly noisy ground truth\ntranscriptions, account for 38.6\\% of high-error cases, indicating that careful\ndata curation is as critical as data volume for robust system performance.\nThese results provide actionable benchmarks and deployment guidance for teams\ndeveloping ASR systems across similar low-resource language contexts.

        "abstract": "The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of\nurban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction\nembedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing\nmultidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study\npresents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment\ninconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent\nStreet view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text\nposts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object\ndetection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in\nBeijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is\nanalysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word\nfrequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The\nperception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly\ndistributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map\nshows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities\nbetween the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the\nyears. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with\nelements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps\npresent perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and\noffer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in\nformulating strategies for urban renewal.",

Automated patent subject classification represents\none of the hardest HTC scenarios because of domain knowledge difficulty and a\nhuge number of labels. Prior approaches only output a flat label set, which\noffers little insight into the reason behind predictions. Therefore, we propose\nReasoning for Hierarchical Classification (RHC), a novel framework that\nreformulates HTC as a step-by-step reasoning task to sequentially deduce\nhierarchical labels. RHC trains large language models (LLMs) in two stages: a\ncold-start stage that aligns outputs with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\nformat and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to enhance multi-step reasoning\nability. RHC demonstrates four advantages in our experiments. (1)\nEffectiveness: RHC surpasses previous baselines and outperforms the supervised\nfine-tuning counterparts by approximately 3% in accuracy and macro F1. (2)\nExplainability: RHC produces natural-language justifications before prediction\nto facilitate human inspection. (3) Scalability: RHC scales favorably with\nmodel size with larger gains compared to standard fine-tuning. (4)\nApplicability: Beyond patents, we further demonstrate that RHC achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on other widely used HTC benchmarks, which\nhighlights its broad applicability.",

This naturally leads to a question: As\nenvironmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation\nfor long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the\neffectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is\nconventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its\neffectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas\n(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., \"move [OBJ]\nto [OBJ]\" -> \"move apple to desk\") to ensure concise action space and reliable\nscalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human\ncognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format\nrestriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual\nframework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action\nrepresentations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection\npoint between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve\nas evidence of the need for scalable representations.

Traditional reliance on\nmachine translation often introduces semantic misalignment and cultural\ninaccuracies. In this work, we address these challenges by creating a\ncross-lingual instruction tuning dataset for Luxembourgish, without resorting\nto machine-generated translations into it. Instead, by leveraging aligned data\nfrom English, French, and German, we build a high-quality dataset that\npreserves linguistic and cultural nuances. We provide evidence that\ncross-lingual instruction tuning not only improves representational alignment\nacross languages but also the model's generative capabilities in Luxembourgish.\nThis highlights how cross-lingual data curation can avoid the common pitfalls\nof machine-translated data and directly benefit low-resource language\ndevelopment.",

        "abstract": "While automatic metrics drive progress in Machine Translation (MT) and Text\nSummarization (TS), existing metrics have been developed and validated almost\nexclusively for English and other high-resource languages. This narrow focus\nleaves Indian languages, spoken by over 1.5 billion people, largely overlooked,\ncasting doubt on the universality of current evaluation practices. To address\nthis gap, we introduce ITEM, a large-scale benchmark that systematically\nevaluates the alignment of 26 automatic metrics with human judgments across six\nmajor Indian languages, enriched with fine-grained annotations. Our extensive\nevaluation, covering agreement with human judgments, sensitivity to outliers,\nlanguage-specific reliability, inter-metric correlations, and resilience to\ncontrolled perturbations, reveals four central findings: (1) LLM-based\nevaluators show the strongest alignment with human judgments at both segment\nand system levels; (2) outliers exert a significant impact on metric-human\nagreement; (3) in TS, metrics are more effective at capturing content fidelity,\nwhereas in MT, they better reflect fluency; and (4) metrics differ in their\nrobustness and sensitivity when subjected to diverse perturbations.\nCollectively, these findings offer critical guidance for advancing metric\ndesign and evaluation in Indian languages.",

        "abstract": "Despite their remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have been underutilized for retrieval tasks. We present\nSearch-R3, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by adapting LLMs to\ngenerate search embeddings as a direct output of their reasoning process. Our\napproach exploits LLMs' chain-of-thought capabilities, allowing them to produce\nmore effective embeddings by reasoning step-by-step through complex semantic\nanalyses. We implement this through three complementary mechanisms. (1) a\nsupervised learning stage enables the model's ability to produce quality\nembeddings, (2) a reinforcement learning (RL) methodology that optimizes\nembedding generation alongside reasoning, and (3) a specialized RL environment\nthat efficiently handles evolving embedding representations without requiring\ncomplete corpus re-encoding at each training iteration. Our extensive\nevaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Search-R3 significantly\noutperforms prior methods by unifying the reasoning and embedding generation\nprocesses. This integrated post-training approach represents a substantial\nadvancement in handling complex knowledge-intensive tasks that require both\nsophisticated reasoning and effective information retrieval.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach to mitigate\nhallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal applications, but its\nreliability is critically dependent on the accuracy of the retrieval step. This\nis particularly challenging in the legal domain, where large databases of\nstructurally similar documents often cause retrieval systems to fail. In this\npaper, we address this challenge by first identifying and quantifying a\ncritical failure mode we term Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM), where\nthe retriever selects information from entirely incorrect source documents. To\nmitigate DRM, we investigate a simple and computationally efficient technique\nwhich we refer to as Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC). This method enhances\neach text chunk with a document-level synthetic summary, thereby injecting\ncrucial global context that would otherwise be lost during a standard chunking\nprocess. Our experiments on a diverse set of legal information retrieval tasks\nshow that SAC greatly reduces DRM and, consequently, also improves text-level\nretrieval precision and recall. Interestingly, we find that a generic\nsummarization strategy outperforms an approach that incorporates legal expert\ndomain knowledge to target specific legal elements. Our work provides evidence\nthat this practical, scalable, and easily integrable technique enhances the\nreliability of RAG systems when applied to large-scale legal document datasets.",

Generative AI has\nrecently become a valuable asset for cybersecurity researchers and\npractitioners, and the field of cyber-deception is no exception. Researchers\nhave demonstrated how LLMs can be leveraged to create realistic-looking\nhoneytokens, fake users, and even simulated systems that can be used as\nhoneypots.

All of these can be deployed and used as honeypots, thus\nVelLMes offers a variety of choices for deception design based on the users'\nneeds. VelLMes is designed to be attacked by humans, so interactivity and\nrealism are key for its performance. We evaluate the generative capabilities\nand the deception capabilities. Generative capabilities were evaluated using\nunit tests for LLMs. The results of the unit tests show that, with careful\nprompting, LLMs can produce realistic-looking responses, with some LLMs having\na 100% passing rate. In the case of the SSH Linux shell, we evaluated deception\ncapabilities with 89 human attackers. The results showed that about 30% of the\nattackers thought that they were interacting with a real system when they were\nassigned an LLM-based honeypot. Lastly, we deployed 10 instances of the SSH\nLinux shell honeypot on the Internet to capture real-life attacks.

        "abstract": "Despite rapid progress, ASR evaluation remains saturated with short-form\nEnglish, and efficiency is rarely reported. We present the Open ASR\nLeaderboard, a fully reproducible benchmark and interactive leaderboard\ncomparing 60+ open-source and proprietary systems across 11 datasets, including\ndedicated multilingual and long-form tracks. We standardize text normalization\nand report both word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx),\nenabling fair accuracy-efficiency comparisons. For English transcription,\nConformer encoders paired with LLM decoders achieve the best average WER but\nare slower, while CTC and TDT decoders deliver much better RTFx, making them\nattractive for long-form and offline use. Whisper-derived encoders fine-tuned\nfor English improve accuracy but often trade off multilingual coverage. All\ncode and dataset loaders are open-sourced to support transparent, extensible\nevaluation.",

        "title": "Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis in LLM Reasoning Traces",
        "abstract": "The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective\ncommunication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit\nthis principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,\nasking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,\nwe propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce\ntwo complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.\nAcross the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that\nstep-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also\nyields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces\nwith more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by\n10-32\\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals\nthat correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,\nwhile incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results\ndemonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform\nalternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results\nhighlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and\nselection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.",

        "title": "SHANKS: Simultaneous Hearing and Thinking for Spoken Language Models",
        "abstract": "Current large language models (LLMs) and spoken language models (SLMs) begin\nthinking and taking actions only after the user has finished their turn. This\nprevents the model from interacting during the user's turn and can lead to high\nresponse latency while it waits to think. Consequently, thinking after\nreceiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction,\nwhere real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting\nthat humans naturally \"think while listening.\" In this paper, we propose\nSHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken\nchain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams\nthe input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received,\ngenerates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while\nthe user continues speaking. SHANKS uses this unspoken reasoning to decide\nwhether to interrupt the user and to make tool calls to complete the task. We\ndemonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two\nscenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math\nproblem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a\nmistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that\ninterrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can\ncomplete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn. Overall,\nSHANKS moves toward models that keep thinking throughout the conversation, not\nonly after a turn ends. Animated illustrations of Shanks can be found at\nhttps://d223302.github.io/SHANKS/",

        "title": "LongRM: Revealing and Unlocking the Context Boundary of Reward Modeling",
        "abstract": "Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in aligning large language model (LLM)\nwith human preferences. As real-world applications increasingly involve long\nhistory trajectories, e.g., LLM agent, it becomes indispensable to evaluate\nwhether a model's responses are not only high-quality but also grounded in and\nconsistent with the provided context. Yet, current RMs remain confined to\nshort-context settings and primarily focus on response-level attributes (e.g.,\nsafety or helpfulness), while largely neglecting the critical dimension of long\ncontext-response consistency. In this work, we introduce Long-RewardBench, a\nbenchmark specifically designed for long-context RM evaluation, featuring both\nPairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks. Our preliminary study reveals that\neven state-of-the-art generative RMs exhibit significant fragility in\nlong-context scenarios, failing to maintain context-aware preference judgments.\nMotivated by the analysis of failure patterns observed in model outputs, we\npropose a general multi-stage training strategy that effectively scales\narbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs). Experiments show that\nour approach not only substantially improves performance on long-context\nevaluation but also preserves strong short-context capability. Notably, our 8B\nLongRM outperforms much larger 70B-scale baselines and matches the performance\nof the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model.",
