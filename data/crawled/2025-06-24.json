        "abstract": "This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual\nunderstanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation.\nAt its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into\ndiscrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language\nmodel's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space\nwith an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input\nand output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific\ndesigns. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to\nbalance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to\nproduce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we\nutilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a\ndiffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced\npre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and\ngeneration. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses\nexisting multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater\ntraining efficiency.

In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a\nnovel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the\ntrajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both\nstep-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward\nassignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt\nReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online\nsettings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for\ndownstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense\nprocess-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning,\nand (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results\non challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond\ndemonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs\n(e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our\nderived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving\naverage gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement\nlearning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling.

We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance\ndegradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the\nQwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable\nimprovements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization\nremains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring\nlong context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory\nbottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with\nminimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context\nlength on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

This\ndesign enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models\nwithout the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text\ngeneration capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed\ncomprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and\nin-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism\ntailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset\nbased on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2\nachieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including\ntext-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,\nalso referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named\nOmniContext.

        "abstract": "The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:\nUnderstanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of\nProblem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,\nwhere the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a\nspecific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling\nlimitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion\nof thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a\nconsequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.",

Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on\n''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic\nlong-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT\ndata, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and\nconsistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support\nthis, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved\nlength control, writing quality, and structural formatting.

While recent work has explored static steering\napproaches to mitigate this issue, they lack the adaptability to dynamically\nadjust intervention strength based on real-time reasoning quality. We propose\nSTUPID (Steering Token Usage via PID controller), a novel training-free method\nthat employs a PID controller to dynamically modulate activation steering\nstrength during inference. Our approach combines a chunk-level classifier for\ndetecting redundant reasoning patterns with a PID control mechanism that\nadaptively adjusts steering intensity based on the predicted redundancy\nprobability. Experimental evaluation on GSM8K demonstrates that STUPID achieves\na 6% improvement in accuracy while reducing token usage by 32%, outperforming\nstatic steering baselines. Our method provides a principled framework for\ndynamic reasoning calibration that maintains reasoning quality while\nsignificantly improving computational efficiency.",

Our\nsubmission addresses the unique challenges of real-time translation of\nlong-form speech by developing a modular cascade system that adapts strong\npre-trained models to streaming scenarios. We combine Whisper Large-V3-Turbo\nfor ASR with the multilingual NLLB-3.3B model for MT, implementing lightweight\nadaptation techniques rather than training new end-to-end models from scratch.\nOur approach employs document-level adaptation with prefix training to enhance\nthe MT model's ability to handle incomplete inputs, while incorporating\nadaptive emission policies including a wait-$k$ strategy and RALCP for managing\nthe translation stream. Specialized buffer management techniques and\nsegmentation strategies ensure coherent translations across long audio\nsequences. Experimental results on the ACL60/60 dataset demonstrate that our\nsystem achieves a favorable balance between translation quality and latency,\nwith a BLEU score of 31.96 and non-computational-aware StreamLAAL latency of\n2.94 seconds.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for\nfuture work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,\nand progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by\ntraining on formal constitutional principles.",

Traditional ad recommendation models,\nprimarily designed for foregrounded experiences, often struggle to reconcile\nthe platform's inherent audio-centrality with the demands of optimizing ad\nperformance across multiple formats and modalities. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce Cross-modal Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (CAMoE), a\nnovel framework for optimizing click-through rate (CTR) prediction in both\naudio-centric and multi-modal settings. CAMoE enhances traditional\nmixture-of-experts models by incorporating modality-aware task grouping,\nadaptive loss masking, and deep-cross networks (DCN) to capture complex feature\ninteractions within a multi-modal ad ecosystem. Through extensive ablation\nstudies, we demonstrate that this approach achieves near Pareto-optimal\nperformance across audio, video, and display ad formats, significantly\nimproving AUC-PR compared to conventional single-task and content-based\nmulti-task learning baselines.

The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers\nconsistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead\nto meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or\neven slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original\ntraining corpus.",

However, for challenging\ncorpora, we argue that enhancing queries alone is insufficient for robust\nsemantic matching; the LLM should also have sufficient understanding of the\ncorpus by directly handling and augmenting the documents themselves. To this\nend, we present an LLM-based retriever empowered to augment both user queries\nand corpus documents, with its policy fully explored via reinforcement learning\n(RL) and minimal human inductive bias. Notably, we find that simply allowing\nthe LLM to modify documents yields little benefit unless paired with our\ncarefully designed bidirectional RL framework, which enables the LLM to\nsimultaneously learn and collaborate on both query and document augmentation\npolicies. A key technical challenge in realizing such a framework lies in\njointly updating both policies during training, where the rewards for the two\ndirections depend on each other, making their entangled reward intractable. Our\napproach addresses this by introducing a reward sampling strategy and a\nspecifically designed RL algorithm that enables effective training with these\nsampled rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly enhances LLM-based retrieval performance in both sparse and dense\nsettings, particularly in difficult retrieval domains, and achieves strong\ncross-benchmark generalization.

To\naddress this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers\nthe discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed\nreward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning\nprocess, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence.

On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO\nwith only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits\na 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar\nduration.

SGEC systems typically\nfollow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),\ndisfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation\nacross modules.

Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are\ncompared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E\nsystems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an\nautomatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data\nfrom 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,\nadditional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.\nCandidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving\nperformance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate\nof the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of\nthis feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to\nremove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.\nFinally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation\napproach, to exclude low-confidence edits.

        "abstract": "The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their\neffectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive\nevaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and\ndomain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to\nvarious tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual\nentailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek\nacross five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text\nsummarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured\nexperimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both\nmodels are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two\nbenchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and\nformal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification\nstability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks\nrequiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide\nvaluable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.",

Furthermore,\nrecent work used accurate and cleanly formatted lyrics sourced from a lyrics\nprovider database to detect AI-generated music.

The key to effective multi-scenario\nrecommendation lies in capturing both user preferences shared across all\nscenarios and scenario-aware preferences specific to each scenario. However,\nexisting methods often overlook user-specific modeling, limiting the generation\nof personalized user representations. To address this, we propose PERSCEN, an\ninnovative approach that incorporates user-specific modeling into\nmulti-scenario matching. PERSCEN constructs a user-specific feature graph based\non user characteristics and employs a lightweight graph neural network to\ncapture higher-order interaction patterns, enabling personalized extraction of\npreferences shared across scenarios.

To enhance efficient and flexible\ninformation transfer, we introduce a progressive scenario-aware gated linear\nunit that allows fine-grained, low-latency fusion.

However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively\nexpensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression\nframework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient\nvariants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our\nmethod systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and\ntransferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the\nperformance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this\nframework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to\ncreate Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE\n(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of\nthe original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned\non a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them\nhighly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and\nremain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves\nsimilar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated\nparameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having\nsignificantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning\ncombined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating\nhigh-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE\narchitectures.

While traditional embedding-based profiles lack\ninterpretability and adaptability, recent advances with large language models\n(LLMs) enable text-based profiles that are semantically richer and more\ntransparent. However, existing methods often adhere to fixed formats that limit\ntheir ability to capture the full diversity of user behaviors. In this paper,\nwe introduce LettinGo, a novel framework for generating diverse and adaptive\nuser profiles. By leveraging the expressive power of LLMs and incorporating\ndirect feedback from downstream recommendation tasks, our approach avoids the\nrigid constraints imposed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Instead, we employ\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the profile generator with\ntask-specific performance, ensuring that the profiles remain adaptive and\neffective. LettinGo operates in three stages: (1) exploring diverse user\nprofiles via multiple LLMs, (2) evaluating profile quality based on their\nimpact in recommendation systems, and (3) aligning the profile generation\nthrough pairwise preference data derived from task performance.

This primary\nlimitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which\nresults in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the\nchallenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of\ngenerating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of\nthe reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct\nanswer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free\nframework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the\nLLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal\nand maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the\nhigh variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and\npropose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable\nreward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four\ngeneral-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR\nconsistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama,\nand Qwen based models.

To\nsupport dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated\nrouter at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to\nre-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than\nbeing statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing\nmechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the\nmodel's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under\nfixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to\n1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling\naxis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional\nwidth/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance\nof 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%\nrelative to other scaling strategies.

To help close this gap, we\nintroduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining\nmultiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers,\nwhich typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform\nunweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce\ndependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each\nverifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better\nreflects true response quality.

However, like previous language models, reasoning\nmodels are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are\nincorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is\ncritical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.\nTo this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this\nwork. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning\nmodels well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model\ncalibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their\nthought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,\nwe ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning\nabout their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated).

Each token in the QuranMorph was manually lemmatized and\ntagged with its part-of-speech by three expert linguists. The lemmatization\nprocess utilized lemmas from Qabas, an Arabic lexicographic database linked\nwith 110 lexicons and corpora of 2 million tokens. The part-of-speech tagging\nwas performed using the fine-grained SAMA/Qabas tagset, which encompasses 40\ntags. As shown in this paper, this rich lemmatization and POS tagset enabled\nthe QuranMorph corpus to be inter-linked with many linguistic resources.

        "abstract": "We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in\nlarge language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE)\nfeatures collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on country-relation\ntasks, we show that ablating semantic components for countries and relations\nchanges model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components\ninduces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and country\ncomponents yields compound counterfactual outputs. We find that, whereas most\ncountry components emerge from the very first layer, the more abstract relation\ncomponents are concentrated in later layers. Furthermore, within relation\ncomponents themselves, nodes from later layers tend to have a stronger causal\nimpact on model outputs. Overall, these findings suggest a modular organization\nof knowledge within LLMs and advance methods for efficient, targeted model\nmanipulation.",

        "abstract": "Model merging has gained increasing attention due to its intriguing property:\ninterpolating the parameters of different task-specific fine-tuned models leads\nto multi-task abilities. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying\nmechanisms of model merging remain poorly understood. In this work, we delve\ninto the mechanism behind model merging from a representation perspective. Our\nanalysis reveals that model merging achieves multi-task abilities through two\nkey capabilities: i) distinguishing samples from different tasks, and ii)\nadapting to the corresponding expert model for each sample. These two\ncapabilities allow the merged model to retain task-specific expertise, enabling\nefficient multi-task adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose\n\\texttt{SE-Merging}, a self-enhanced model merging framework that leverages\nthese two characteristics to dynamically identify the corresponding task for\neach sample and then adaptively rescales the merging coefficients to further\nenhance task-specific expertise in the merged model. Notably,\n\\texttt{SE-Merging} achieves dynamic model merging without additional training.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that \\texttt{SE-Merging} achieves significant\nperformance improvements while remaining compatible with existing model merging\ntechniques.",

        "abstract": "We identify a critical vulnerability in autoregressive transformer language\nmodels where the em dash token induces recursive semantic drift, leading to\nclause boundary hallucination and embedding space entanglement. Through formal\nanalysis of token-level perturbations in semantic lattices, we demonstrate that\nem dash insertion fundamentally alters the model's latent representations,\ncausing compounding errors in long-form generation. We propose a novel solution\ncombining symbolic clause purification via the phi-infinity operator with\ntargeted embedding matrix realignment. Our approach enables total suppression\nof problematic tokens without requiring model retraining, while preserving\nsemantic coherence through fixed-point convergence guarantees. Experimental\nvalidation shows significant improvements in generation consistency and topic\nmaintenance. This work establishes a general framework for identifying and\nmitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models, with immediate\nimplications for AI safety, model alignment, and robust deployment of large\nlanguage models in production environments. The methodology extends beyond\npunctuation to address broader classes of recursive instabilities in neural\ntext generation systems.",

Each entry\nis labeled with its grammatical status (\"well-formedness\" according to\nsyntactic formalisms) extracted from the literature, as well as its\nacceptability status (\"intuitive goodness\" as determined by native speakers)\nobtained through crowdsourcing, with highest experimental standards. Even in\nits preliminary form, this dataset stands as the largest of its kind that is\npublicly accessible. We also offer preliminary analyses addressing three\ndebates in linguistics and computational linguistics: We observe that\ngrammaticality and acceptability judgments converge in about 83% of the cases\nand that \"in-betweenness\" occurs frequently. This corroborates existing\nresearch. We also find that while machine learning models struggle with\npredicting grammaticality, they perform considerably better in predicting\nacceptability.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental healthcare risk propagating biases\nthat reinforce stigma and harm marginalized groups. While previous research\nidentified concerning trends, systematic methods for detecting intersectional\nbiases remain limited. This work introduces a multi-hop question answering\n(MHQA) framework to explore LLM response biases in mental health discourse. We\nanalyze content from the Interpretable Mental Health Instruction (IMHI) dataset\nacross symptom presentation, coping mechanisms, and treatment approaches. Using\nsystematic tagging across age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status, we\ninvestigate bias patterns at demographic intersections. We evaluate four LLMs:\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet, Jamba 1.6, Gemma 3, and Llama 4, revealing systematic\ndisparities across sentiment, demographics, and mental health conditions. Our\nMHQA approach demonstrates superior detection compared to conventional methods,\nidentifying amplification points where biases magnify through sequential\nreasoning. We implement two debiasing techniques: Roleplay Simulation and\nExplicit Bias Reduction, achieving 66-94% bias reductions through few-shot\nprompting with BBQ dataset examples. These findings highlight critical areas\nwhere LLMs reproduce mental healthcare biases, providing actionable insights\nfor equitable AI development.",
