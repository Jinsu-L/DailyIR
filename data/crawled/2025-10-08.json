        "title": "TaTToo: Tool-Grounded Thinking PRM for Test-Time Scaling in Tabular Reasoning",
        "abstract": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework\nfor enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),\nparticularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their\npotential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains\nunderexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing\nPRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle\nwith table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema\ninteraction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this\nlimitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)\nreasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based\nverification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design\na scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality\nstep-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with\ntool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a\ndual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use\nreasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded\nreward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly\ndesigned PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering\nnumerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves\ndownstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines\nsuch as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong\ngeneralizability across diverse TTS strategies.",

        "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as\nsearch engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement\nlearning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that\nStratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3\npoints, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more\neffective search policies. These results establish stratification as a\nprincipled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances\nboth accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a\nreasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of\ntext-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization\nprocess driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function\ndesigned to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our\napproach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for\nlanguage-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include\nimportant relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality\ndictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our\napproach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our\nexperiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two\ncommon failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited\none-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning\nwith Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing\nprior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our\nreward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute).

        "abstract": "Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large\nnumber of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech\ntokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation\nbenchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the\nrepresentational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer\nfrom shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of\nspeech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute\nimbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,\nand a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately\ntranslating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce\nthe Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text\nmodels more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech\ntokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units\nthat can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability\ntransfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more\ncompute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on\nspeech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and\ncompute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective\nrepresentational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for\nspeech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute\ngain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under\ndata-controlled training, while also improving text performance.

        "abstract": "A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models\n(LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent\n\"Ann loves pie\" by binding \"Ann\" to \"pie\", allowing it to later retrieve \"Ann\"\nwhen asked \"Who loves pie?\" Prior research on short lists of bound entities\nfound strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional\nmechanism, where \"Ann\" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this\nwork, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;\nas the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism\nbecomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we\nfind that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism\n(retrieving \"Ann\" using its bound counterpart \"pie\") and a reflexive mechanism\n(retrieving \"Ann\" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on\nnine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs\nmix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to\ndevelop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token\ndistributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes\nto substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity\ngroups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural\nsettings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs\nbind and retrieve entities in-context.",

Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a\nhallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \\textbf{commitment\nlayer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from\nfactuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We\nobserve a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret\nusing the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \\textbf{associative\npathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \\textbf{contextual pathway}\n(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as\n\\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the\ncoherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation\n($\\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are\npredictable consequences of internal semantic weakness.

This paper introduces a principled auditing\nframework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a\ncomprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to\nnot only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical\naudit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing\nnon-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential\nrounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics\nthat expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where\nthe inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level\nutility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used\ndirectly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions\ncomparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework\nsuccessfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and\ninterpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees.

In\nparticular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for\neliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context\nsteerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its\npriors and steer to a novel data generating distribution.

        "abstract": "Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS)\nhave applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex\nsyntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise\nquestions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al.\n(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the \"wh-effect\") to demonstrate\nthat models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan\net al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that\nmodels largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct\nminimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate\nthis by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and\nevaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic\nWilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across\nall four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing\nprinciples even in complex PG environments.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that\nrequire extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse\nchains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two\ncompeting objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple\nreasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.\nExisting works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly\nuncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while\nothers improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence\npost-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer\nquality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different\nsources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should\nbe calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from\ntokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected\ncorrectness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:\nGreedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.\nCalibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on\nestimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing\nheuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and\ngeneral reasoning benchmarks.",

However, LLMs have\nlargely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy\nthem in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular\nsafety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on\nconstrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based\n(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of\nenvironments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in\na principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning\nenvironments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained\nproblems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to\nsolve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of\nsupported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment\ngenerators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This\nrenders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems\ncan be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments\nreveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning\nmodels like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of\nthe planning tasks increases.",

In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained\nanalysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated\nGradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the\ncontext. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context\nnoise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and\nbenefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context\nDenoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy\nthat improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on\nmodel predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context\nwindow scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority\nof CDT.

Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong\nITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when\nguided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early\nin the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:\nit myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially\ncorrect hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,\nknown as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained\ncomputational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two\nroot causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident\nresampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning\npath. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that\nintegrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,\nEntropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by\nmonitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by\ndynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The\nsecond, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive\nguide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several\nchallenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and\nachieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these\nmethods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse\nsolution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately\nleading to higher-quality solutions.",

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities,\ntheir reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation\nbarrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into\nEnglish. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages\ndeteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.\nExisting cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage\nmonolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead\nreinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning\n(CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively\ntransitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and\ninstruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly\nscaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts\nas an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and\nreduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments\nacross 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive\nand reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently\noutperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target\nand unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in\nlow-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen\nlanguages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust\napproach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs\ntoward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.",

        "abstract": "Large language models have achieved impressive performance across diverse\ntasks. However, their tendency to produce overconfident and factually incorrect\noutputs, known as hallucinations, poses risks in real world applications.\nConformal prediction provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage\nguarantees, but standard conformal prediction breaks down under domain shift,\noften leading to under-coverage and unreliable prediction sets. We propose a\nnew framework called Domain-Shift-Aware Conformal Prediction (DS-CP). Our\nframework adapts conformal prediction to large language models under domain\nshift, by systematically reweighting calibration samples based on their\nproximity to the test prompt, thereby preserving validity while enhancing\nadaptivity. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on the MMLU benchmark\ndemonstrate that the proposed method delivers more reliable coverage than\nstandard conformal prediction, especially under substantial distribution\nshifts, while maintaining efficiency. This provides a practical step toward\ntrustworthy uncertainty quantification for large language models in real-world\ndeployment.",

It typically involves a language model\nto generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide\nthe selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained\nwith direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains\nunderexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work,\nwe investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference\noptimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt\nas a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit\nsubstantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy\nprompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into\ntraining fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight\ndegradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that\nthe performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model\ncapacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model\ncapacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the\nnegative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that\nselectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances\noverall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons\nlearned.",

This paper\nintroduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression\nscheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant\nchallenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly\nin terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address\nthese challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which\neffectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on\nlow-resource devices.\n  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce\nAdaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that\nprogressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8\nbits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively\nallocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise\nimportance using bit regularization.\n  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,\ndelivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better\nclassification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,\nit significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit\nrepresentation collapse during the training.\n  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical\nmulti-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference\naccuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during\ntraining. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for\ncollaborative training with minimal communication cost.",

Current\ndefense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of\nknown attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually\ncrafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents\nvulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose\nAdversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework\nthat leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the\nproblem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker\nthat learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent\nthat learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To\nensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic\nlearning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent\nto defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym\nand AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower\nattack success rate than the original model while also improving their task\nsuccess rate.

In fact, it is naturally inherited from CQM/QPict. At its heart is\nthe explicit notational representation of relations that exist within and\nbetween the key concepts of music composition, performance, and automation.

While most of the Western classical music notation has heavily\nrelied on linear representation of music - which does not always adequately\ncapture the nature of music - our approach is distinct by highlighting the\nfundamental relational dimension of music. In addition, this quantum-based\ntechnique not only influences the music at the profound level of composition,\nbut also has a direct impact on a live performance, and also provides a new\ntemplate for automating music, e.g.~in the context of AI-generation.\n  All together, we initiate the creation of new music formalism that is\npowerful and efficient in capturing the interactive nature of music, both in\nterms of internal and external interactions, and goes beyond the boundaries of\nWestern classical music notation, which allows to use it in many different\ngenres and directions.",

        "title": "Context Length Alone Hurts LLM Performance Despite Perfect Retrieval",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on\nlong-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.\nThis gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability\nto identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent\nefforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if\nretrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a\nlong input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents\nfindings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic\nexperiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,\nand coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all\nrelevant information, their performance still degrades substantially\n(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'\nclaimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are\nreplaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when\nthey are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant\ntokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is\nplaced immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a\npreviously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt\nLLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.\nThey motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a\nlong-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the\nretrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe\na consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.",

        "abstract": "Responsible use of Authorship Verification (AV) systems not only requires\nhigh accuracy but also interpretable solutions. More importantly, for systems\nto be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's\nprediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to\nthe original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their\nrepresentations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions\ncannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a\nprediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's\nprediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel\nmethod that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural\nnetwork to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability.\nAuthorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is\nto measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural\nnetwork to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity\npredicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets\nshows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship\nverification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final\nprediction is faithful and interpretable.",

These qualitative accounts\nprovide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely\nabsent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists\nto understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized\nquality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into\nstructured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.\nWeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which\nmeasures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over\none million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which\nevaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal\nvulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.\nExtensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well\nas a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical\nterminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience\nconcepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex\nsocietal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust\nclimate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts.

External LLM-based\nguardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and\noutputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are\nvulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval\nAugmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust\nLLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the\ncontext. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss\nmodels, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context\nalters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of\ncases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each\ncomponent in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and\nLLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor\nimprovements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current\nguardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to\nretrieval and query composition.",

In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring\nentity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct\nAsian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for\nassociation with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173\nnaturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media\nposts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual\nLLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation,\nsentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle\nby LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance\ndiffering across models developed in regions with varying access to\nculturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold\ntheir distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular\nsentiments.

Such monolithic\nrewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to\ncapture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data\nannotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward\nmodeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)\nmodel-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector\nscores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where\ndomain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with\nconfidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to\nenforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward\nto stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides\na flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement\nlearning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements\nacross different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect\nreward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall\naverage improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks.

In this paper, we therefore perform a\nseries of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing\nencoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for\ntime-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).\nWe find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when\nexisting approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other\ndomains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the\npotential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel\napproaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic\nbidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall\nperformance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model\nadaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance.

An ideal exploration strategy must\nnavigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also\nensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is\nsimple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures\ndegrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we\npropose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding\n(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early\ntokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an\nintuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by\nannealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This\ndynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then\ngradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the\nsampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable\ntraining. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that\nsignificantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming\nfixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes.
