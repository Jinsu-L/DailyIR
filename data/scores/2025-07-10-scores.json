Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on\ntheir individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of\ncomplex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a\nset-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly\nidentifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought\nreasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy\nthose requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR\noutperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in\nterms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and\nefficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems.

        "abstract": "The rapid expansion of digital information and knowledge across structured\nand unstructured sources has heightened the importance of Information Retrieval\n(IR). While dense retrieval methods have substantially improved semantic\nmatching for general queries, they consistently underperform on queries with\nexplicit temporal constraints--often those containing numerical expressions and\ntime specifiers such as ``in 2015.'' Existing approaches to Temporal\nInformation Retrieval (TIR) improve temporal reasoning but often suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced performance on non-temporal\nqueries. To address this, we propose Time-Specifier Model Merging (TSM), a\nnovel method that enhances temporal retrieval while preserving accuracy on\nnon-temporal queries. TSM trains specialized retrievers for individual time\nspecifiers and merges them in to a unified model, enabling precise handling of\ntemporal constraints without compromising non-temporal retrieval. Extensive\nexperiments on both temporal and non-temporal datasets demonstrate that TSM\nsignificantly improves performance on temporally constrained queries while\nmaintaining strong results on non-temporal queries, consistently outperforming\nother baseline methods.

To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external\nknowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing\nhallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most\nnotably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate\nretrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different\ncomponents in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our\nanalysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade\nsignificantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in\nisolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering\nsetting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets.

        "abstract": "Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large\nlanguage models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model\nfinetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent\ncomplexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,\nreward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial\nperturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically\nrely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,\nlimiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is\nunavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution\nagnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided\ncontrolled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving\nreward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model\nitself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial\nexamples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward\nmodel's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference\ndatasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate\nthat it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.\nNotably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in\ndownstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing\nspurious correlations.",

        "abstract": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine\ninteractions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile\nphones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks\nin a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices\nraises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor\nattacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual\ngrounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce\nvulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack\ntargeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when\ngiven correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose\nVisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to\nlocate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.\nVisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and\ndoes so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical\nfeasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can\neffectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and\nhighly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack\ncan be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,\nthe injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,\ne.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.\nThese findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor\nattack risks in GUI agents.",

Temporal\nanalysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to\nevaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance\nstrategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as\nmanual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the\ncomplex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing\nrelevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,\nparticularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.\nIn this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded\ntopic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.\nA probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over\ntime. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the\npostponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals\nshifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to\nrecent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,\nfinance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,\nincluding preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word\ndistributions.

Section 4 discusses the\nimplications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and\nrefinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.",

        "abstract": "Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information\nin extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using\ntest-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can\neffectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning\nmethods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,\npreventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose\nPERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for\nlearning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight\nmodel adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization\nloops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a\nlow-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for\nthe base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter\nto accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long\ncontext. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK\nsignificantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,\nachieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models\n(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In\ngeneral, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and\nthe locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while\nPERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at\ninference time than prompt-based long-context inference.",

This work explores parameter pruning to\nimprove parameter efficiency while maintaining recommendation quality, thereby\nenabling easier deployment. Unlike existing approaches that focus primarily on\ninter-layer redundancy, we uncover intra-layer redundancy within components\nsuch as self-attention and MLP modules. Building on this analysis, we propose a\nmore fine-grained pruning approach that integrates both intra-layer and\nlayer-wise pruning. Specifically, we introduce a three-stage pruning strategy\nthat progressively prunes parameters at different levels and parts of the\nmodel, moving from intra-layer to layer-wise pruning, or from width to depth.\nEach stage also includes a performance restoration step using distillation\ntechniques, helping to strike a balance between performance and parameter\nefficiency.

        "abstract": "Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes\nunder herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which\ngrapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed\nfor Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM\noutputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data\nimposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign,\na novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging\ntheoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather\nthan complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training\nLLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than\nusing real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we\ndevelop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which\ndemonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT\nmodels in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our\nproposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address\ncomplex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor\ndecision-making processes under herd behavior.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in\nrecent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has\npossessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods\nhave revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its\npotential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache\nreduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our\nobservation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on\nthis observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV,\nwhich balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an\nattention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a\ncodebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging\npolicy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma\nfaced by other attention based eviction methods.

        "abstract": "The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves\nmonolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks\nflexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model\ndevelopment, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input\nembeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can\nemerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual\nstructure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed\nrepresentational substrate acts as a universal \"docking port,\" enabling two\npowerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and\nprogressive layer-wise growth.\n  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,\nRussian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural\nmodification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The\nresulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning\nbenchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic\nforgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training\nmethodology, where a deep Transformer is \"grown\" by progressively stacking and\ntraining one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a\nclear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning\nabilities, such as those required for SQuAD.\n  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a\nmore biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is\nbuilt incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues\nfor resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized\necosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to\nfacilitate further research.",

This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also\ncompromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks\nutilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we\nsystematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing\nmulti-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite\nthoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method\n(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,\naimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated\ntest cases.

The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)\nof the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%\nhigher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6.

One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume.

In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of\noutput token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are\nlargely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference\ndynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to\nanalyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens\nacross 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with\nhigher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain\nand uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at\nsimilar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent\nmodels may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the\nfeasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at\ninference.

        "abstract": "The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers\nmay seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs\nand review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that\nused a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources\nincluded in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also\nused to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken\nwhich found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%)\nwhen extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6%\nand 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all\ndata items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1\nscores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and\nmethodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and\nmisattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate\nand suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of\n38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value.\nHowever, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors,\nonly 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for\nexpediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs\nand review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering\napproaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if\nusing them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM\nfeedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review\nprotocol drafting.",

        "abstract": "Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with\nlarge language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant\nchallenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,\nmaking them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a\nnew approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved\ndata efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time\nscaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL\nsamples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL\ntraining with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or\nextensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more\nefficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves\ninference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate\nour approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS\nsurpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy\nusing only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%\nimprovement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning\nbenchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU.

However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,\nleading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.\nDespite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention\ncomponent has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various\nlinear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced\ngating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this\ncomprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M\nparameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six\nlinear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on\nstandard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone\nlinear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling\nremains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly\nimproves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.\nOur study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled\nforgetting as critical for effective hybrid models.

However, its design and optimizations remain\ntailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when\napplied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major\nsource of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of\nvisual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy\nOptimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages\nthe model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal\nsupervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,\nexternal reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the\nImplicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO\nobjective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall\nimprovements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more\npronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also\nobserve a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating\nimproved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis\nof PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze\nand mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a\ndeeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning\nobjectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages\nvisually grounded reasoning.

However,\nmultimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality\nalignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data\nannotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and\nreasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits\nscalability. To address these challenges, we propose the\nDeliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the\nunderstanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra\nannotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate\nreasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based\nformat reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to\nintuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and\nimplicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I\noutperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our\nfindings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable\nreasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time\nreasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.",

        "title": "Civil Society in the Loop: Feedback-Driven Adaptation of (L)LM-Assisted Classification in an Open-Source Telegram Monitoring Tool",
        "abstract": "The role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in monitoring harmful online\ncontent is increasingly crucial, especially as platform providers reduce their\ninvestment in content moderation. AI tools can assist in detecting and\nmonitoring harmful content at scale. However, few open-source tools offer\nseamless integration of AI models and social media monitoring infrastructures.\nGiven their thematic expertise and contextual understanding of harmful content,\nCSOs should be active partners in co-developing technological tools, providing\nfeedback, helping to improve models, and ensuring alignment with stakeholder\nneeds and values, rather than as passive 'consumers'. However, collaborations\nbetween the open source community, academia, and civil society remain rare, and\nresearch on harmful content seldom translates into practical tools usable by\ncivil society actors. This work in progress explores how CSOs can be\nmeaningfully involved in an AI-assisted open-source monitoring tool of\nanti-democratic movements on Telegram, which we are currently developing in\ncollaboration with CSO stakeholders.",

        "title": "Can Interpretation Predict Behavior on Unseen Data?",
        "abstract": "Interpretability research often aims to predict how a model will respond to\ntargeted interventions on specific mechanisms. However, it rarely predicts how\na model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and\nchallenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution\n(OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between\nattention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models\nindependently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit\nseveral distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse\npopulation for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple\nobservational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In\nparticular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the\nmodel is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the\nrule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according\nto ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further\ninterpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.",
