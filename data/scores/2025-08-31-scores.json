        "abstract": "Retrievability of a document is a collection-based statistic that measures\nits expected (reciprocal) rank of being retrieved within a specific rank\ncut-off. A collection with uniformly distributed retrievability scores across\ndocuments is an indicator of fair document exposure. While retrievability\nscores have been used to quantify the fairness of exposure for a collection, in\nour work, we use the distribution of retrievability scores to measure the\nexposure bias of retrieval models. We hypothesise that an uneven distribution\nof retrievability scores across the entire collection may not accurately\nreflect exposure bias but rather indicate variations in topical relevance. As a\nsolution, we propose a topic-focused localised retrievability measure, which we\ncall \\textit{T-Retrievability} (topic-retrievability), which first computes\nretrievability scores over multiple groups of topically-related documents, and\nthen aggregates these localised values to obtain the collection-level\nstatistics. Our analysis using this proposed T-Retrievability measure uncovers\nnew insights into the exposure characteristics of various neural ranking\nmodels. The findings suggest that this localised measure provides a more\nnuanced understanding of exposure fairness, offering a more reliable approach\nfor assessing document accessibility in IR systems.",

Recent studies, however, report a\nconcerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by\nwell-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This\npaper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding\neffects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We\ntheoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,\nshowing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature\ndistributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also\ninvestigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that\nthey introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However,\nlogging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user\nbehavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement\nacross positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these\neffects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using\ntwo-tower models.",

        "abstract": "Modeling user interest based on lifelong user behavior sequences is crucial\nfor enhancing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. However, long post-click\nbehavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume\nof data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training\nand inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage\napproaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete\nutilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating\nmultimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents\nsignificant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens\nand mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the\nmodel's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest\nNetwork (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences\ncontain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps,\nDMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete\nlifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no\nadditional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing\nmultimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from\ngrouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors\nwithin each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers\nto capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally\nordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive\nexperiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness\nand efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that\nDMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%.",

        "abstract": "In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to\nmodel users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods\nare mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to\ncomprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing\nto directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate\nprediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle\ncommonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to\nconsider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex\ninteractions between modalities.\n  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based\nMulti-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through\nprediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal\nFeature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,\nand the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC\nModule extract synergistic, common, and special information among different\nmodalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,\nimproving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among\ndifferent features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the\nFDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive\nexperiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results\ndemonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least\n1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing\nmulti-modal recommendation systems.

However,\nexisting LLMs still face two major challenges that hinder their broader\nadoption: (1) their responses tend to be generic and lack personalization\ntailored to individual users, and (2) they rely heavily on cloud infrastructure\ndue to intensive computational requirements, leading to stable network\ndependency and response delay. Recent research has predominantly focused on\neither developing cloud-based personalized LLMs or exploring the on-device\ndeployment of general-purpose LLMs. However, few studies have addressed both\nlimitations simultaneously by investigating personalized on-device language\nmodels. To bridge this gap, we propose CDCDA-PLM, a framework for deploying\npersonalized on-device language models on user devices with support from a\npowerful cloud-based LLM. Specifically, CDCDA-PLM leverages the server-side\nLLM's strong generalization capabilities to augment users' limited personal\ndata, mitigating the issue of data scarcity.

The key challenge for reasoning\ntasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning\nchains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic\nConfidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that\nscores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the\nreasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final\nanswer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.\nPiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,\n+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in\n16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains\nexhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the\neffectiveness of PiCSAR.",

Our key contribution is a modern implementation built on Keras 3 and\nJAX, which provides an increase in computational efficiency. Experiments show\nthat NewsReX is faster than current implementations. To support broader\nresearch, we provide a straightforward guide and scripts for training models on\ncustom datasets. We validated this functionality using a proprietary Japanese\nnews dataset from Nikkei News, a leading Japanese media corporation renowned\nfor its comprehensive coverage of business, economic, and financial news.\nNewsReX makes reproducing complex experiments faster and more accessible to a\nwider range of hardware making sure the speed up it also achieved for less\npowerful GPUs, like an 8GB RTX 3060 Ti. Beyond the library, this paper offers\nan analysis of key training parameters often overlooked in the literature,\nincluding the effect of different negative sampling strategies, the varying\nnumber of epochs, the impact of random batching, and more.

To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that\naggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets\ncalled PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and\nCoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through\ninferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the\nperformance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the\ndevelopment and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion\ndetection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.\nWe also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics\nto ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and\nclosed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each\nconsisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model.

This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn\nconversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.\nOur approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large\nLanguage Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that\nmaximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given\nthe responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a\nprincipled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief\ndistribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its\nconstruction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific\ninnovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely\nrelying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a\ntargeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM\nachieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on\nthe 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,\ncompared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.",

While data selection and data synthesis are two\ncommon strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face\nlimitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model\ncapabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed\ndynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and\ncontext-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off\nfiltering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop\noptimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively\nidentifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns\n(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores\n(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal\nsamples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic\nintegrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model\ncapability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our \\method consistently enhances the quality of\nseed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on\naverage while maintaining the original dataset scale.

        "title": "Normality and the Turing Test",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of\nnormality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.",

        "abstract": "Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group\nfairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific\nunderstanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work\non both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives\nfor each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the\ntwo. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness\nmay affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and\nindividual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures\nthat can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3\ndatasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very\nunfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners\naiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/theresiavr/stairway-to-fairness.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both\nresearch and real-world applications, but they still struggle with\nhallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on\nsentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While\nself-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high\ncomputational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the\nfirst study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested\nas shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer\ntokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,\nwe propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation\nthrough selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the\nmodel, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP\nconsistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds\npromise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments\nshow that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC\nperformance.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents two studies on how Brazilian children (ages 9--11) use\nconversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment, and\nhow structured scaffolds can enhance these interactions. In Study 1, a\nseven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents,\nteachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map\nchildren's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others,\nfunctional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform\nconversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery,\nEntertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support.\nIn Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges,\ncomparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an\nunstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question\ncount/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach.\nBuilding on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded\nconversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and\ncaregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application\nwith Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows,\nand an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective,\nscaffolded learning.",

        "abstract": "Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for\npreventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors\nAnalysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and\nconsistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification\nframework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning\nwith Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B\nlanguage model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system\ntailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation\nto overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized\nmodel achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact\nmatch accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy\nof 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art\nLLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key\nmetrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS\nclassification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the\nadvanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work\nvalidates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally\nefficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes\npowerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.",

        "abstract": "Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is\nrepresented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress\nis shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a\ncomprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs\nas a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We\nformulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of\nscientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and\ndomain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general\nnatural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,\nfrom general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse\nscientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270\npre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --\nheterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require\nrepresentations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal\nreasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a\nshift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with\nadvanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent\nissues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving\nsemi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline\na paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on\nSci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving\nknowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building\ntrustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that\nfunction as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.",
