        "abstract": "We present Apertus, a fully open suite of large language models (LLMs)\ndesigned to address two systemic shortcomings in today's open model ecosystem:\ndata compliance and multilingual representation. Unlike many prior models that\nrelease weights without reproducible data pipelines or regard for content-owner\nrights, Apertus models are pretrained exclusively on openly available data,\nretroactively respecting robots.txt exclusions and filtering for\nnon-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content. To mitigate risks\nof memorization, we adopt the Goldfish objective during pretraining, strongly\nsuppressing verbatim recall of data while retaining downstream task\nperformance. The Apertus models also expand multilingual coverage, training on\n15T tokens from over 1800 languages, with ~40% of pretraining data allocated to\nnon-English content. Released at 8B and 70B scales, Apertus approaches\nstate-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks,\nrivalling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Beyond model weights, we\nrelease all scientific artifacts from our development cycle with a permissive\nlicense, including data preparation scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites,\nand training code, enabling transparent audit and extension.",

        "abstract": "We show that language models' activations linearly encode when information\nwas learned during training. Our setup involves creating a model with a known\ntraining order by sequentially fine-tuning Llama-3.2-1B on six disjoint but\notherwise similar datasets about named entities. We find that the average\nactivations of test samples for the six training datasets encode the training\norder: when projected into a 2D subspace, these centroids are arranged exactly\nin the order of training and lie on a straight line. Further, we show that\nlinear probes can accurately (~90%) distinguish \"early\" vs. \"late\" entities,\ngeneralizing to entities unseen during the probes' own training. The model can\nalso be fine-tuned to explicitly report an unseen entity's training stage (~80%\naccuracy). Interestingly, this temporal signal does not seem attributable to\nsimple differences in activation magnitudes, losses, or model confidence. Our\npaper demonstrates that models are capable of differentiating information by\nits acquisition time, and carries significant implications for how they might\nmanage conflicting data and respond to knowledge modifications.",

To address this gap, we propose GEM-Bench, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark for ad-injected response generation in GEM.

Our preliminary results indicate that, while simple prompt-based\nmethods achieve reasonable engagement such as click-through rate, they often\nreduce user satisfaction.

        "title": "Dense Video Understanding with Gated Residual Tokenization",
        "abstract": "High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in\nvideo understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and\nbenchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or\nkeyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise\navoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to\nredundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While\nthis trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like\nlecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and\nrequires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense\nVideo Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by\nreducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are\nalso limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore\npropose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed\nfor dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual\nTokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated\nTokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during\ntokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)\nSemantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions\nwithin a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.\nExperiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales\npositively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal\ninformation and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video\nunderstanding.",

Using open-weight LLMs, we annotate each\nstatement with high-level stances toward migrants and track the net tone toward\nmigrants across time and political parties. For the UK, we extend this with a\nsemi-automated framework for extracting fine-grained narrative frames to\ncapture nuances of migration discourse. Our findings show that, while US\ndiscourse has grown increasingly polarised, UK parliamentary attitudes remain\nrelatively aligned across parties, with a persistent ideological gap between\nLabour and the Conservatives, reaching its most negative level in 2025. The\nanalysis of narrative frames in the UK parliamentary statements reveals a shift\ntoward securitised narratives such as border control and illegal immigration,\nwhile longer-term integration-oriented frames such as social integration have\ndeclined. Moreover, discussions of national law about immigration have been\nreplaced over time by international law and human rights, revealing nuances in\ndiscourse trends. Taken together broadly, our findings demonstrate how LLMs can\nsupport scalable, fine-grained discourse analysis in political and historical\ncontexts.",

Among the essential capabilities required for AGI,\ncreativity has emerged as a critical trait for MLLMs, with association serving\nas its foundation. Association reflects a model' s ability to think creatively,\nmaking it vital to evaluate and understand. While several frameworks have been\nproposed to assess associative ability, they often overlook the inherent\nambiguity in association tasks, which arises from the divergent nature of\nassociations and undermines the reliability of evaluations. To address this\nissue, we decompose ambiguity into two types-internal ambiguity and external\nambiguity-and introduce AssoCiAm, a benchmark designed to evaluate associative\nability while circumventing the ambiguity through a hybrid computational\nmethod. We then conduct extensive experiments on MLLMs, revealing a strong\npositive correlation between cognition and association. Additionally, we\nobserve that the presence of ambiguity in the evaluation process causes MLLMs'\nbehavior to become more random-like. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of\nour method in ensuring more accurate and reliable evaluations. See Project Page\nfor the data and codes.",

        "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by\nprompting intermediate steps, improving accuracy and robustness in arithmetic,\nlogic, and commonsense tasks. However, this benefit comes with high\ncomputational costs: longer outputs increase latency, memory usage, and\nKV-cache demands. These issues are especially critical in software engineering\ntasks where concise and deterministic outputs are required. To investigate\nthese trade-offs, we conduct an empirical study based on code generation\nbenchmarks. The results reveal that longer CoT does not always help. Excessive\nreasoning often causes truncation, accuracy drops, and latency up to five times\nhigher, with failed outputs consistently longer than successful ones. These\nfindings challenge the assumption that longer reasoning is inherently better\nand highlight the need for adaptive CoT control. Motivated by this, we propose\nSEER (Self-Enhancing Efficient Reasoning), an adaptive framework that\ncompresses CoT while preserving accuracy. SEER combines Best-of-N sampling with\ntask-aware adaptive filtering, dynamically adjusting thresholds based on\npre-inference outputs to reduce verbosity and computational overhead. We then\nevaluate SEER on three software engineering tasks and one math task. On\naverage, SEER shortens CoT by 42.1%, improves accuracy by reducing truncation,\nand eliminates most infinite loops. These results demonstrate SEER as a\npractical method to make CoT-enhanced LLMs more efficient and robust, even\nunder resource constraints.",

Mobile code commonly\nsuffers from large amounts of stalls in the CPU frontend and thus starvation of\nthe rest of the CPU resources. Complexity of these applications and their code\nfootprint are projected to grow at a rate faster than available on-chip memory\ndue to power and area constraints, making conventional hardware-centric methods\nfor managing instruction caches to be inadequate. We present a novel\nsoftware-hardware co-design approach called TRRIP (Temperature-based\nRe-Reference Interval Prediction) that enables the compiler to analyze,\nclassify, and transform code based on \"temperature\" (hot/cold), and to provide\nthe hardware with a summary of code temperature information through a\nwell-defined OS interface based on using code page attributes.

Unlike gloss (sign language\ntranscription) annotations, dialogue naturally occurs in communication and is\neasier to annotate. The key challenge lies in aligning multimodality features\nwhile leveraging the context of the question to improve translation. To address\nthis issue, we propose a cross-modality Self-supervised Learning with Sigmoid\nSelf-attention Weighting (SSL-SSAW) fusion method for sign language\ntranslation. Specifically, we employ contrastive learning to align\nmultimodality features in QB-SLT, then introduce a Sigmoid Self-attention\nWeighting (SSAW) module for adaptive feature extraction from question and sign\nlanguage sequences. Additionally, we leverage available question text through\nself-supervised learning to enhance representation and translation\ncapabilities. We evaluated our approach on newly constructed CSL-Daily-QA and\nPHOENIX-2014T-QA datasets, where SSL-SSAW achieved SOTA performance.

While such systems have been proposed, an open questions is\nwhether the mixture of different document languages impacts generation and\ncitation in unintended ways. To investigate, we introduce a controlled\nmethodology using model internals to measure language preference while holding\nother factors such as document relevance constant. Across eight languages and\nsix open-weight models, we find that models preferentially cite English sources\nwhen queries are in English, with this bias amplified for lower-resource\nlanguages and for documents positioned mid-context. Crucially, we find that\nmodels sometimes trade-off document relevance for language preference,\nindicating that citation choices are not always driven by informativeness\nalone.

Previous studies have revealed the misalignment of\nLLMs with human values using expert-designed or agent-based emulated bias\nscenarios. However, it remains unclear whether the alignment of LLMs with human\nvalues differs across different types of scenarios (e.g., scenarios containing\nnegative vs. non-negative questions). In this study, we investigate the\nalignment of LLMs with human values regarding social biases (HVSB) in different\ntypes of bias scenarios. Through extensive analysis of 12 LLMs from four model\nfamilies and four datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs with large model parameter\nscales do not necessarily have lower misalignment rate and attack success rate.\nMoreover, LLMs show a certain degree of alignment preference for specific types\nof scenarios and the LLMs from the same model family tend to have higher\njudgment consistency. In addition, we study the understanding capacity of LLMs\nwith their explanations of HVSB. We find no significant differences in the\nunderstanding of HVSB across LLMs. We also find LLMs prefer their own generated\nexplanations. Additionally, we endow smaller language models (LMs) with the\nability to explain HVSB. The generation results show that the explanations\ngenerated by the fine-tuned smaller LMs are more readable, but have a\nrelatively lower model agreeability.",

In Germany, more than 40% of the population\nspeaks a regional dialect (Adler and Hansen, 2022). However, despite cultural\nimportance, individuals speaking dialects often face negative societal\nstereotypes. We examine whether such stereotypes are mirrored by large language\nmodels (LLMs). We draw on the sociolinguistic literature on dialect perception\nto analyze traits commonly associated with dialect speakers. Based on these\ntraits, we assess the dialect naming bias and dialect usage bias expressed by\nLLMs in two tasks: an association task and a decision task. To assess a model's\ndialect usage bias, we construct a novel evaluation corpus that pairs sentences\nfrom seven regional German dialects (e.g., Alemannic and Bavarian) with their\nstandard German counterparts. We find that: (1) in the association task, all\nevaluated LLMs exhibit significant dialect naming and dialect usage bias\nagainst German dialect speakers, reflected in negative adjective associations;\n(2) all models reproduce these dialect naming and dialect usage biases in their\ndecision making; and (3) contrary to prior work showing minimal bias with\nexplicit demographic mentions, we find that explicitly labeling linguistic\ndemographics--German dialect speakers--amplifies bias more than implicit cues\nlike dialect usage.",

Integrating external\ntools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent\nadvances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing\ntool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and\nenhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR\n(Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen,\na multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality\ndatasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and\ngeneralizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained\nhierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes\nfor both trajectory-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This\nis motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call\nis a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR\nincorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback\nto dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach\ndemonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing\neffectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models.

Here we present a natural language processing (NLP)\nscreening tool to detect high-severity incident reports in radiation oncology\nacross two institutions.\n  METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used two text datasets to train and evaluate our\nNLP models: 7,094 reports from our institution (Inst.), and 571 from IAEA\nSAFRON (SF), all of which had severity scores labeled by clinical content\nexperts. We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector\nmachines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on\nPubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data. We assessed for\ngeneralizability of our model in two ways. First, we evaluated models trained\nusing Inst.-train on SF-test. Second, we trained a BlueBERT_TRANSFER model that\nwas first fine-tuned on Inst.-train then on SF-train before testing on SF-test\nset. To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59\nreports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.\n  RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82\nusing SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT. Without cross-institution transfer learning,\nperformance on the SF test was limited to an AUROC of 0.42 using SVM and 0.56\nusing BlueBERT. BlueBERT_TRANSFER, which was fine-tuned on both datasets,\nimproved the performance on SF test to AUROC 0.78. Performance of SVM, and\nBlueBERT_TRANSFER models on the manually curated Inst. reports (AUROC 0.85 and\n0.74) was similar to human performance (AUROC 0.81).\n  CONCLUSION: In summary, we successfully developed cross-institution NLP\nmodels on incident report text from radiation oncology centers. These models\nwere able to detect high-severity reports similarly to humans on a curated\ndataset.",

        "title": "SteeringControl: Holistic Evaluation of Alignment Steering in LLMs",
        "abstract": "We introduce SteeringControl, a benchmark for evaluating representation\nsteering methods across core alignment objectives--bias, harmful generation,\nand hallucination--and their effects on secondary behaviors such as sycophancy\nand commonsense morality. While prior alignment work often highlights\ntruthfulness or reasoning ability to demonstrate the side effects of\nrepresentation steering, we find there are many unexplored tradeoffs not yet\nunderstood in a systematic way. We collect a dataset of safety-relevant primary\nand secondary behaviors to evaluate steering effectiveness and behavioral\nentanglement centered around five popular steering methods. To enable this, we\ncraft a modular steering framework based on unique components that serve as the\nbuilding blocks of many existing methods. Our results on Qwen-2.5-7B and\nLlama-3.1-8B find that strong steering performance is dependent on the specific\ncombination of steering method, model, and targeted behavior, and that severe\nconcept entanglement can result from poor combinations of these three as well.\nWe release our code here:\nhttps://github.com/wang-research-lab/SteeringControl.git.",
