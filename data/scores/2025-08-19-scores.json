        "abstract": "Medical large vision-language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown promise in\nclinical applications but suffer from factual inaccuracies and unreliable\noutputs, posing risks in real-world diagnostics. While retrieval-augmented\ngeneration has emerged as a potential solution, current medical multimodal RAG\nsystems are unable to perform effective retrieval across heterogeneous sources.\nThe irrelevance of retrieved reports affects the factuality of analysis, while\ninsufficient knowledge affects the credibility of clinical decision-making. To\nbridge the gap, we construct MedAtlas, which includes extensive multimodal\nreport repositories and diverse text corpora. Based on it, we present\nHeteroRAG, a novel framework that enhances Med-LVLMs through heterogeneous\nknowledge sources. The framework introduces Modality-specific CLIPs for\neffective report retrieval and a Multi-corpora Query Generator for dynamically\nconstructing queries for diverse corpora. Incorporating knowledge from such\nmultifaceted sources, Med-LVLM is then trained with Heterogeneous Knowledge\nPreference Tuning to achieve cross-modality and multi-source knowledge\nalignment. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 modalities\ndemonstrate that the proposed HeteroRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance\nin most medical vision language benchmarks, significantly improving factual\naccuracy and reliability of Med-LVLMs.",

        "abstract": "Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and\noverthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and\ncheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the\ndevelopment of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the\nonus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this\nwork, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly\nevaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the\ndevelopment of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and\nefficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench,\nfeaturing simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11\nchallenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we\nperform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models\nand show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking\nmodels often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries\nwithout improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models\nunderthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further\nexplore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these\napproaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other,\nhighlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.",

However, a critical challenge remains: the\nsemantic mismatch between natural language questions (NLQs) and their\ncorresponding SQL queries. This issue is exacerbated in large-scale databases,\nwhere semantically similar attributes hinder schema linking and semantic drift\nduring SQL generation, ultimately reducing model accuracy. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce CRED-SQL, a framework designed for large-scale\ndatabases that integrates Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description. CRED-SQL\nfirst performs cluster-based large-scale schema retrieval to pinpoint the\ntables and columns most relevant to a given NLQ, alleviating schema mismatch.\nIt then introduces an intermediate natural language representation-Execution\nDescription Language (EDL)-to bridge the gap between NLQs and SQL. This\nreformulation decomposes the task into two stages: Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL,\nleveraging LLMs' strong general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic\ndeviation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale, cross-domain\nbenchmarks-SpiderUnion and BirdUnion-demonstrate that CRED-SQL achieves new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating its effectiveness and\nscalability.

        "abstract": "LLM-based web agents have the potential to automate long-running web tasks,\nsuch as finding offers for specific products in multiple online shops and\nsubsequently ordering the cheapest products that meet the users needs. This\npaper introduces WebMall, a multi-shop online shopping benchmark for evaluating\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of web agents for comparison-shopping. WebMall\nconsists of four simulated online shops populated with authentic product offers\nsourced from the Common Crawl, alongside a suite of 91 cross-shop tasks. These\ntasks include basic tasks such as finding specific products in multiple shops,\nperforming price comparisons, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing\ncheckout. Advanced tasks involve searching for products based on vague\nrequirements, identifying suitable substitutes, and finding compatible\nproducts. Compared to existing e-commerce benchmarks, such as WebShop or\nShoppingBench, WebMall introduces comparison-shopping tasks across multiple\nshops. Furthermore, the product offers are more heterogeneous, as they\noriginate from hundreds of distinct real-world shops. The tasks in WebMall\nrequire longer interaction trajectories than those in WebShop, while remaining\nrepresentative of real-world shopping behaviors. We evaluate eight baseline\nagents on WebMall, varying in observation modality, memory utilization, and\nunderlying large language model (GPT 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4). The\nbest-performing configurations achieve completion rates of 75% and 53%, and F1\nscores of 87% and 63%, on the basic and advanced task sets, respectively.\nWebMall is publicly released to facilitate research on web agents and to\npromote advancements in navigation, reasoning, and efficiency within e-commerce\nscenarios.",

The BSC submission to the WMT25\nGeneral Machine Translation shared task is based on the 7B variant of\nSALAMANDRATA. We first adapted the model vocabulary to support the additional\nnon-European languages included in the task. This was followed by a second\nphase of continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, carefully designed\nto optimize performance across all translation directions for this year's\nshared task. For decoding, we employed two quality-aware strategies: Minimum\nBayes Risk Decoding and Tuned Re-ranking using COMET and COMET-KIWI\nrespectively.

The task is framed as a regression problem, where the\nmodel assigns a scalar value from 0 to 100 to each input statement. We evaluate\nmultiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, fixed-context few-shot, and\nretrieval-based prompting using BERT sentence embeddings. Few-shot approaches\nconsistently outperform zero-shot baselines, underscoring the value of\ncontextual examples in affective prediction. To move beyond static evaluation,\nwe introduce the \"Misery Game Show\", a novel gamified framework inspired by a\ntelevision format. It tests LLMs through structured rounds involving ordinal\ncomparison, binary classification, scalar estimation, and feedback-driven\nreasoning. This setup enables us to assess not only predictive accuracy but\nalso the model's ability to adapt based on corrective feedback. The gamified\nevaluation highlights the broader potential of LLMs in dynamic emotional\nreasoning tasks beyond standard regression.

However, their effectiveness in\nmulti-session and long-term interactions is hindered by limited memory\npersistence. Typical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems store\ndialogue history as dense vectors, which capture semantic similarity but\nneglect finer linguistic structures such as syntactic dependencies, discourse\nrelations, and coreference links. We propose Semantic Anchoring, a hybrid\nagentic memory architecture that enriches vector-based storage with explicit\nlinguistic cues to improve recall of nuanced, context-rich exchanges. Our\napproach combines dependency parsing, discourse relation tagging, and\ncoreference resolution to create structured memory entries. Experiments on\nadapted long-term dialogue datasets show that semantic anchoring improves\nfactual recall and discourse coherence by up to 18% over strong RAG baselines.\nWe further conduct ablation studies, human evaluations, and error analysis to\nassess robustness and interpretability.",

        "abstract": "Developing large language models is expensive and involves making decisions\nwith small experiments, typically by evaluating on large, multi-task evaluation\nsuites. In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark\nmore reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality\nevaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in\ncurrent benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models\nfrom worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability\nbetween training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These\nresults suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful\nbenchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect\nsignal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has\nbetter signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better\nreliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy\nsubtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable\nmulti-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's\nintermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We\nconclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which\nexisting benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise. We use 30\nbenchmarks for these experiments, and 375 open-weight language models from 60M\nto 32B parameters, resulting in a new, publicly available dataset of 900K\nevaluation benchmark results, totaling 200M instances.",

There has been a\nsubstantial body of research developing models for determining if a social\nmedia post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on\nexploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that\ncan be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational\nexchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent\ntweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if\na reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the\nmost? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from\nthe context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only\nlooking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,\nwe test four different classification models on a dataset made of\nconversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as\nabusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features\nleads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from\nthe reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We\nobserve that, among the features under study, it is especially the\ncontent-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the\nclassification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting\nit). While using content-based features, it is best to combine a range of\ndifferent features to ensure improved performance over being more selective and\nusing fewer features.

This paradigm faces limitations when the\ndesired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe\nanswer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal\nactivity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert\nwhen asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained\nsteering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using\ncontrastive input-specific prompting.

Although existing\ndetection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to\nfeatures used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of\nLLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively\ncapture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between\nLLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this\nhypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural\nactivation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we\npropose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.\nSpecifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of\nLGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better\nidentify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of\nthe text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a\nprecomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms\nall baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD\nscenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and\nmainstream attacks.

While prior work has\nexamined social and positional biases, the specific forms of bias pertinent to\ncontact center operations - which we term Operational Bias - have remained\nunexplored. To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon\na taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic)\nfor the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages\nan LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each\nbias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary. The bias is then\nquantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between\ndistributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted).

        "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nstrong mathematical reasoning abilities but rely on hundreds of billions of\nparameters. To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models\n(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of\ndata for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,\nwhich resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.\nHowever, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is\nfirst acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two\ndistinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA\nInteraction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input\nthe question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create\nknowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student\nmodel as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts\nfor problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge\nGenerator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only\nknowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to\nperform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR\nand DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference\nprocess needs to be iterated if not. This step can enhance the mathematical\nreasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback. Experimental results show\nthat LoRID achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on the GSM8K\ndataset, where it outperforms the second-best method by 2.3%, 16.1%, 2.4%,\n12.3%, and 1.8% accuracy across the five base models, respectively.",

        "title": "When Alignment Hurts: Decoupling Representational Spaces in Multilingual Models",
        "abstract": "Alignment with high-resource standard languages is often assumed to aid the\nmodeling of related low-resource varieties. We challenge this assumption by\ndemonstrating that excessive representational entanglement with a dominant\nvariety, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in relation to Arabic dialects,\ncan actively hinder generative modeling. We present the first comprehensive\ncausal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the\ninternal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs). Our key\ncontribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously\nestimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling\nprojection-based decoupling from this space. While our study uses Arabic as a\ncase due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the\nbroader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy\nfor generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable.\nAcross 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9\nchrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured\ntradeoff in standard-language performance. These results provide causal\nevidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict\ngenerative capacity for related varieties. More generally, we unify geometric\nand information-theoretic probing with subspace-level causal interventions,\noffering practical tools for improving generative modeling in closely related\nlanguage families and, more broadly, for controlling representational\nallocation in multilingual and multi-domain LLMs. Code will be released.",

Existing reasoning datasets often\neither lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit\nrobust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd\nReasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive\nraw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary\nchallenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of\na Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human\neducators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design\nlogics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these\ndesign logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create\nreasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing\ndatasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning\ndatasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book),\ncontaining 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus,\nand Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging\nquestions from the web corpus.

We validate the\neffectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the\nQwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models.

Early efforts to\nidentify LLM-generated fake news have predominantly focused on the textual\ncontent itself; however, because much of that content may appear coherent and\nfactually consistent, the subtle traces of falsification are often difficult to\nuncover. Through distributional divergence analysis, we uncover prompt-induced\nlinguistic fingerprints: statistically distinct probability shifts between\nLLM-generated real and fake news when maliciously prompted. Based on this\ninsight, we propose a novel method named Linguistic Fingerprints Extraction\n(LIFE). By reconstructing word-level probability distributions, LIFE can find\ndiscriminative patterns that facilitate the detection of LLM-generated fake\nnews. To further amplify these fingerprint patterns, we also leverage\nkey-fragment techniques that accentuate subtle linguistic differences, thereby\nimproving detection reliability. Our experiments show that LIFE achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in LLM-generated fake news and maintains high\nperformance in human-written fake news.

This paper\npresents a very first systematic study of MLLM for comprehensive ASA,\ndemonstrating the superior performance of MLLM across the aspects of content\nand language use .

Whereas, these models primarily focus on\nclassifying contexts as rumors or not, lacking the capability to locate and\nmark specific rumor content. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a\nnovel rumor detection model named Insight Rumors to locate and mark rumor\ncontent within textual data. Specifically, we propose the Bidirectional Mamba2\nNetwork with Dot-Product Attention (Att_BiMamba2), a network that constructs a\nbidirectional Mamba2 model and applies dot-product attention to weight and\ncombine the outputs from both directions, thereby enhancing the representation\nof high-dimensional rumor features. Simultaneously, a Rumor Locating and\nMarking module is designed to locate and mark rumors. The module constructs a\nskip-connection network to project high-dimensional rumor features onto\nlow-dimensional label features. Moreover, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is\nemployed to impose strong constraints on the output label features, ensuring\naccurate rumor content location. Additionally, a labeled dataset for rumor\nlocating and marking is constructed, with the effectiveness of the proposed\nmodel is evaluated through comprehensive experiments. Extensive experiments\nindicate that the proposed scheme not only detects rumors accurately but also\nlocates and marks them in context precisely, outperforming state-of-the-art\nschemes that can only discriminate rumors roughly.",

Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nand existing preference optimization methods like RLHF and DPO frequently\nstruggle to efficiently leverage the model's own generation space to identify\nhighly informative \"hard negative\" samples. To address these challenges, we\npropose Multimodal-Model-Guided Preference Optimization (M3PO), a novel and\ndata-efficient method designed to enhance LVLMs' capabilities in visual\ninstruction following. M3PO intelligently selects the most \"learning-valuable\"\npreference sample pairs from a diverse pool of LVLM-generated candidates. This\nselection is driven by a sophisticated mechanism that integrates two crucial\nsignals: a Multimodal Alignment Score (MAS) to assess external quality and the\nmodel's Self-Consistency / Confidence (log-probability) to gauge internal\nbelief. These are combined into a novel M3P-Score, which specifically\nidentifies preferred responses and challenging dispreferred responses that the\nmodel might confidently generate despite being incorrect. These high-quality\npreference pairs are then used for efficient Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) fine-tuning on base LVLMs like LLaVA-1.5 (7B/13B) using LoRA.

However, evaluating these models remains a challenge,\nparticularly for resource-limited languages like Turkish. To address this\nissue, we introduce the Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU) benchmark, a comprehensive\nevaluation framework designed to assess the linguistic and conceptual\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. TR-MMLU is based on a\nmeticulously curated dataset comprising 6,200 multiple-choice questions across\n62 sections within the Turkish education system. This benchmark provides a\nstandard framework for Turkish NLP research, enabling detailed analyses of\nLLMs' capabilities in processing Turkish text. In this study, we evaluated\nstate-of-the-art LLMs on TR-MMLU, highlighting areas for improvement in model\ndesign. TR-MMLU sets a new standard for advancing Turkish NLP research and\ninspiring future innovations.",

However,\nlong-horizon, multi-constraint planning tasks involve conditioning on detailed\ninformation and satisfying complex interdependent constraints, which can pose a\nchallenge for these systems. In this study, we construct an LLM-based MAS for a\ntravel planning task which is representative of these challenges. We evaluate\nthe impact of a notebook to facilitate information sharing, and evaluate an\norchestrator agent to improve coordination in free form conversation between\nagents. We find that the notebook reduces errors due to hallucinated details by\n18%, while an orchestrator directs the MAS to focus on and further reduce\nerrors by up to 13.5% within focused sub-areas. Combining both mechanisms\nachieves a 25% final pass rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, a 17.5% absolute\nimprovement over the single-agent baseline's 7.5% pass rate. These results\nhighlight the potential of structured information sharing and reflective\norchestration as key components in MASs for long horizon planning with LLMs.",

The lack of\na comprehensive evaluation and diverse data in existing multilingual safety\nevaluations for LLMs limits their effectiveness, hindering the development of\nrobust multilingual safety alignment. To address this critical gap, we\nintroduce LinguaSafe, a comprehensive multilingual safety benchmark crafted\nwith meticulous attention to linguistic authenticity. The LinguaSafe dataset\ncomprises 45k entries in 12 languages, ranging from Hungarian to Malay. Curated\nusing a combination of translated, transcreated, and natively-sourced data, our\ndataset addresses the critical need for multilingual safety evaluations of\nLLMs, filling the void in the safety evaluation of LLMs across diverse\nunder-represented languages from Hungarian to Malay. LinguaSafe presents a\nmultidimensional and fine-grained evaluation framework, with direct and\nindirect safety assessments, including further evaluations for oversensitivity.\nThe results of safety and helpfulness evaluations vary significantly across\ndifferent domains and different languages, even in languages with similar\nresource levels. Our benchmark provides a comprehensive suite of metrics for\nin-depth safety evaluation, underscoring the critical importance of thoroughly\nassessing multilingual safety in LLMs to achieve more balanced safety\nalignment.

        "abstract": "Recently, motivated by the outstanding achievements of diffusion models, the\ndiffusion process has been employed to strengthen representation learning in\nrecommendation systems. Most diffusion-based recommendation models typically\nutilize standard Gaussian noise in symmetric forward and reverse processes in\ncontinuous data space. Nevertheless, the samples derived from recommendation\nsystems inhabit a discrete data space, which is fundamentally different from\nthe continuous one. Moreover, Gaussian noise has the potential to corrupt\npersonalized information within latent representations. In this work, we\npropose a novel and effective method, named Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation\nModel (AsymDiffRec), which learns forward and reverse processes in an\nasymmetric manner. We define a generalized forward process that simulates the\nmissing features in real-world recommendation samples. The reverse process is\nthen performed in an asymmetric latent feature space. To preserve personalized\ninformation within the latent representation, a task-oriented optimization\nstrategy is introduced. In the serving stage, the raw sample with missing\nfeatures is regarded as a noisy input to generate a denoising and robust\nrepresentation for the final prediction. By equipping base models with\nAsymDiffRec, we conduct online A/B tests, achieving improvements of +0.131% and\n+0.166% in terms of users' active days and app usage duration respectively.\nAdditionally, the extended offline experiments also demonstrate improvements.\nAsymDiffRec has been implemented in the Douyin Music App.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled realistic user\nsimulators for developing and evaluating recommender systems (RSs). However,\nexisting LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static\nand single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete\nuser profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round\nrecommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided\nDynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile\nthrough a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation\nfidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each\noptimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module,\ncalibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific\ndefects in the user profile. Subsequently, a generalized LLM-based treatment\nmodule analyzes the diagnosed defect and generates targeted suggestions to\nrefine the profile. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM-based user simulators that\nare limited to single-round interactions, we are the first to integrate DGDPO\nwith sequential recommenders, enabling a bidirectional evolution where user\nprofiles and recommendation strategies adapt to each other over multi-round\ninteractions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic\ntoken level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between\nvariables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or\nsatisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce\ncausal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning\nframework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed\nacyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a\ndataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an\ninput question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated\nanswer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves\nthe causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on\nCLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces\nthe hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements.
