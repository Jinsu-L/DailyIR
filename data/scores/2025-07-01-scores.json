        "abstract": "The global fashion e-commerce industry has become integral to people's daily\nlives, leveraging technological advancements to offer personalized shopping\nexperiences, primarily through recommendation systems that enhance customer\nengagement through personalized suggestions. To improve customers' experience\nin online shopping, we propose a novel comprehensive KiseKloset system for\noutfit retrieval, recommendation, and try-on. We explore two approaches for\noutfit retrieval: similar item retrieval and text feedback-guided item\nretrieval. Notably, we introduce a novel transformer architecture designed to\nrecommend complementary items from diverse categories. Furthermore, we enhance\nthe overall performance of the search pipeline by integrating approximate\nalgorithms to optimize the search process. Additionally, addressing the crucial\nneeds of online shoppers, we employ a lightweight yet efficient virtual try-on\nframework capable of real-time operation, memory efficiency, and maintaining\nrealistic outputs compared to its predecessors. This virtual try-on module\nempowers users to visualize specific garments on themselves, enhancing the\ncustomers' experience and reducing costs associated with damaged items for\nretailers. We deployed our end-to-end system for online users to test and\nprovide feedback, enabling us to measure their satisfaction levels. The results\nof our user study revealed that 84% of participants found our comprehensive\nsystem highly useful, significantly improving their online shopping experience.",

        "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for extending existing DBMSs with vector\nindices so that they become unified systems capable of supporting modern\npredictive applications, which require joint querying of vector embeddings\ntogether with the structured properties and connections of objects. We present\nNaviX, a native vector index for graph DBMSs (GDBMSs) that has two main design\ngoals. First, we aim to implement a disk-based vector index that leverages the\ncore storage and query-processing capabilities of the underlying GDBMS. To this\nend, NaviX is built on the Hierarchical Navigable Small-World (HNSW) graph,\nwhich itself is a graph-based structure. Second, we aim to support\npredicate-agnostic filtered vector search queries, in which the k nearest\nneighbors (kNNs) of a query vector vQ are searched only within an arbitrary\nsubset S of vectors defined by an ad-hoc selection sub-query QS. We adopt a\nprefiltering approach that evaluates QS first and passes the full description\nof subset S to the kNN search operator. We study how to design a prefiltering\nsearch algorithm that remains robust under varying selectivities and under\ndifferent correlations between subset S and query vector vQ. We propose an\nadaptive algorithm that uses the local selectivity of each vector in the HNSW\ngraph to choose an appropriate heuristic at every iteration of the kNN search.\nFinally, We demonstrate NaviX's robustness and efficiency through extensive\nexperiments against both existing prefiltering- and postfiltering-based\nbaselines.",

Concretely, we\nfind that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance\namong hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity\nacross diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,\nnews, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how\ndispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring\nlabeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to\npredict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for\nmodel selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion\npinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,\nbypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple\npush-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both\nsingle-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in\neach.",

        "abstract": "In music information retrieval (MIR), contrastive self-supervised learning\nfor general-purpose representation models is effective for global tasks such as\nautomatic tagging. However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is\nwidely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised\nmodels are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g.,\nmasked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the\npotential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We\nconsider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the\ntime--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL\nthrough normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although\nNT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks\nto weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence\ntokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens\noffers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful\nproperties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform\nunexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore,\nhigh-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention\nmaps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different\nmusical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but\nadvances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some\noverlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence\nmodeling in MIR.",

        "abstract": "The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate\nspeech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.\nDetecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent\ncode-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content\non social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is\ntypically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource\nlanguages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,\nhigh-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this\nlimitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on\nlow-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -\nzero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot\nprompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to\ndetect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the\nmetaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that\nmarks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We\ninvestigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and\ncompare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,\nWord2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer\nperceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated\nrecurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in\nthe low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource\nlanguage - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The\nperformance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and\nenvironmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity\nusage, and computational time.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various\ntasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to\nfully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior\nwork using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved\nevaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and\nmulti-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address\nthese gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for\nclose-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval\nintroduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports\nmulti-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse,\nchallenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments\naddressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source\nLLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of\n7.283\\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the\nlargest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same\nperturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial\neffects by up to 52.932\\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may\noverestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for\nevolution-aware robustness evaluation.

The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT)\nsummaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results\ndemonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such\nas the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics.\nText-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore\nfrom 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework\nimproves F1-Score by almost 23%.

To\nthis end, we present Chunk AutoRegressive Modeling (CAR), a new generation\nparadigm following the decision pattern that users usually think semantic\naspects of items (e.g. brand) and then take actions on target items (e.g.\npurchase). Our CAR, for the $\\textit{first time}$, incorporates semantics\n(SIDs) and behavior (UID) into a single autoregressive transformer from an\n``act-with-think'' dual perspective via chunk-level autoregression.\nSpecifically, CAR packs SIDs and UID into a conceptual chunk for item unified\nrepresentation, allowing each decoding step to make a holistic prediction.\nExperiments show that our CAR significantly outperforms existing methods based\non traditional AR, improving Recall@5 by 7.93% to 22.30%. Furthermore, we\nverify the scaling effect between model performance and SIDs bit number,\ndemonstrating that CAR preliminary emulates a kind of slow-thinking style\nmechanism akin to the reasoning processes observed in large language models\n(LLMs).",

To\noperationalize similarity to previous research, we introduce two complementary\nmetrics to characterize the local geometry of a publication's semantic\nneighborhood: (1) \\emph{density} ($\\rho$), defined as the ratio between a fixed\nnumber of previously-published papers and the minimum distance enclosing those\npapers in a semantic embedding space, and (2) asymmetry ($\\alpha$), defined as\nthe average directional difference between a paper and its nearest neighbors.\nWe tested the predictive relationship between these two metrics and its\nsubsequent citation rate using a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach,\nsurveying $\\sim 53,000$ publications across nine academic disciplines and five\ndifferent document embeddings. While the individual effects of $\\rho$ on\ncitation count are small and variable, incorporating density-based predictors\nconsistently improves out-of-sample prediction when added to baseline models.\nThese results suggest that the density of a paper's surrounding scientific\nliterature may carry modest but informative signals about its eventual impact.\nMeanwhile, we find no evidence that publication asymmetry improves model\npredictions of citation rates.

We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework\nwhere models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously\nimproving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.\nThrough self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively\nchallenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple\nNegotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct\nreasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model\n(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement.

        "abstract": "The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question\nof how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support\nmathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle\ntextual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word\nproblems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the\nreal-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We\nconducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including\nthree parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in\nresearch, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical\nword problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled\nmathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics\neducation. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most\npopular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require\na consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our\nevaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems\nshows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,\nincluding a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed\nweaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or\nnon-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have\nmastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,\nwhich potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics\nclassrooms.",

However, existing MLLM\nbenchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating\nlong-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty\nand diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3)\ninadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we\nintroduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively\nevaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,\nchallenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring\nmulti-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple\ndifficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from\nfoundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated\ninto an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to\neliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust\nreasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed\nstep-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism\nto reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark\npopular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning\ncapabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing\nMLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/HJYao00/MMReason.",

        "title": "Teaching a Language Model to Speak the Language of Tools",
        "abstract": "External tool integration through function-calling is essential for practical\nlanguage model applications, yet most multilingual models lack reliable\ntool-use capabilities in non-English languages. Even state-of-the-art\nmultilingual models struggle with determining when to use tools and generating\nthe structured outputs required for function calls, often exhibiting language\nconfusion when prompted in lower-resource languages. This work presents a\nmethodology for adapting existing language models to enable robust tool use in\nany target language, using Bulgarian as a case study. The approach involves\ncontinued training of the BgGPT model series (2.6B, 9B, 27B parameters) on a\nnovel bilingual dataset of 10,035 function-calling examples designed to support\nstandardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The research\nintroduces TUCAN (Tool-Using Capable Assistant Navigator), which achieves up to\n28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy over base models while\npreserving core language understanding, as verified on established Bulgarian\nbenchmarks. Beyond accuracy gains, TUCAN models demonstrate production-ready\nresponse formatting with clean, parsable function calls, contrasting with the\nverbose and inconsistent outputs of base models. The models, evaluation\nframework, and dataset are released to enable replication for other languages.\nThis work demonstrates a practical approach for extending tool-augmented\ncapabilities beyond English-centric systems.",
