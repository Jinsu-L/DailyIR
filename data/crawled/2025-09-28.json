        "abstract": "The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have\nspurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are\ninadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We\nintroduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI\nassistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval\ncomprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks\ninclude natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn\ndialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly\nheterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21\nopen-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response\ncontent and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key\nfindings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source\nmodels; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;\nand (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the\nmid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening\naccuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal\n(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for\ncurrent models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety\nalignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous\nframework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI\nassistants.

        "title": "See, Point, Fly: A Learning-Free VLM Framework for Universal Unmanned Aerial Navigation",
        "abstract": "We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language\nnavigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is\ncapable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions\nin any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that\ntreat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to\nconsider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF\nharnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative\nannotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted\ntraveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement\nvectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the\ntraveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF\nperforms navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow\ndynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL\nsimulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute\nmargin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong\nbaselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to\nhighlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable\ngeneralization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev",

        "abstract": "Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic\ndomains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable\ndata annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to\nmodels that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality\nand ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the\nlimitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.\nA primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the\ninherently subjective nature of what constitutes a \"good\" caption. We introduce\nCaptioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that\nredefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should\nenable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the\ncorresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM\ngenerates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a\nseparate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on\nthat caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image\ncaptioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple\nsettings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B\nresults in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism\nFramework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable\nto Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.\nCode is available here: https://github.com/InternLM/CapRL.",

We introduce DeeptraceReward, the\nfirst fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates\nhuman-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises\n4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each\nannotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box\nregion containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset\ntimestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of\ndeepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train\nmultimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and\nlocalizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by\n34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.\nInterestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.\nreal classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace\ndetection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language\nexplanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).\nBy foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a\nrigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video\ngeneration.",

However, for\ntasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual\neffects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple\ncode execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture\nthe actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose\nWebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and\nmulti-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website\ncodebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding\nthe screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual\nlanguage model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The\nscreenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and\nselect-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the\naccurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further\nintroduce \\textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve\nthe ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using\nthe screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we\nprovide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively\nimproves the model's website-generation ability.

More recently, it has also been\nadopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work\non creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not\naccount for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and\nappropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the\nrelationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542\nexpert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality\nvia close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram\nnovelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of\ntop-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,\ncautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike\nhuman-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with\nlower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source\nmodels, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative\nexpressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,\nfew-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a\npositive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).\nOverall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave\nroom for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic\nexpressions.

Motivated by this\nobservation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation\nAlignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's\nactivation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.\nPerforming IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy\nand calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results\non 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only\npractically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner\nmechanics of model adaptation.",

        "abstract": "Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on\nmassive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero\nshot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two\nstructural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB\nimages from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)\npatch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets\nand context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative\nvisual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation\nthat parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop\na scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware\npruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about\n97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt\ncontrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen\nRGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a\nperceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large\nDataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K\nperformance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While\naccuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable\nmultimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path\ntoward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission\nefficient for edge cloud learning.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic\ntool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,\nyet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.\nExisting studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but\nsuch mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to\nthe multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive\nexploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own\nexperiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway\ndivergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)\nrecipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a\nreplay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy\nupdate, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range\nof entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum\nto manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster\nskill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.\nAt first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the\naccumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar\ndistributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As\ntraining progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing\nsuccessful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level\nexploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.\nTo further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in\nthe replay buffer to address the potential policy drift.

We identify a\ncritical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation\ncascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature\nconvergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,\nlow-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,\nwhere conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting\nchaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized\nPolicy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle\nthrough three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in\nmulti-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing\nregularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent\nabrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances\nexploration and exploitation across training.

        "abstract": "Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple\nobjectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe\nand reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control\nsignals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via\none-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single\nalignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for\nother objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches\nextend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While\nthis alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize\neach objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs\nacross HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch\nSteering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient\nmulti-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the\nTransformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage\nII, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a\npolicy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while\nmaintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca,\nBeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment\nacross multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves\naverage alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared\nto a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

While prior research\nhas largely focused on disinformation threats, fairness vulnerabilities remain\nunderexplored. Unlike conventional backdoors that rely on direct\ntrigger-to-target mappings, fairness-driven attacks exploit the interaction\nbetween retrieval and generation models, manipulating semantic relationships\nbetween target groups and social biases to establish a persistent and covert\ninfluence on content generation.\n  This paper introduces BiasRAG, a systematic framework that exposes fairness\nvulnerabilities in RAG through a two-phase backdoor attack. During the\npre-training phase, the query encoder is compromised to align the target group\nwith the intended social bias, ensuring long-term persistence. In the\npost-deployment phase, adversarial documents are injected into knowledge bases\nto reinforce the backdoor, subtly influencing retrieved content while remaining\nundetectable under standard fairness evaluations. Together, BiasRAG ensures\nprecise target alignment over sensitive attributes, stealthy execution, and\nresilience.

While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,\nDeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal\nworkflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and\nadversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA\nand Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their\nadversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level\nperturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.\nWe moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to\nsupport multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and\ndatasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,\nsummarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that\nlegal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below\n50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on\ngeneral-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields\nmore stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt\nsensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across\nlanguages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a\nlanguage and its syntactic similarity to English.

We propose\na simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space\nthat captures unanswerability and uses it for classification.

We prove that\nasymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new\ndemonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such\nobjectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a\nvariational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our\nempirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a\nlow-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but\nstandard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,\nhighlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a\ntheoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong\nasymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural\nnetworks that achieve greater compression and generalization.",

        "abstract": "Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear\nstream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process.\nWhile recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform\nwell on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or\nmodality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and\nreason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a\ncomprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from\nWikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by\nsemantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four\nfundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation\nunderstanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to\nmeasure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:\n(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual\npatterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized\nfactual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans\nshortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without\ntrue comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on\nChimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from\nshortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,\nknowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts\ncontribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current\nVLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that\nbenchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)\nrather than question-answering shortcuts.",

        "abstract": "Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the\nresponses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust\nreasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as\ncausal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from\ntraining examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that\nthe dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of\ntransformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional\ngrid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In\naddition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly\nbetter generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the\ngraph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,\ntransformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the\nnumber of components is large.",

Traditional query rewriting relies on human annotators to clarify\nqueries, but due to limitations in annotators' expressive ability and depth of\nunderstanding, manually rewritten queries often diverge from those needed in\nreal-world RAG systems, resulting in a gap between user intent and system\nresponse. We observe that high-quality synthetic queries can better bridge this\ngap, achieving superior performance in both retrieval and generation compared\nto human rewrites. This raises an interesting question: Can rewriting models\ntrained on synthetic queries better capture user intent than human annotators?\nIn this paper, we propose SynRewrite, a synthetic data-driven query rewriting\nmodel to generate high-quality synthetic rewrites more aligned with user\nintent. To construct training data, we prompt GPT-4o with dialogue history,\ncurrent queries, positive documents, and answers to synthesize high-quality\nrewrites. A Flan-T5 model is then finetuned on this dataset to map dialogue\nhistory and queries to synthetic rewrites. Finally, we further enhance the\nrewriter using the generator's feedback through the DPO algorithm to boost\nend-task performance. Experiments on TopiOCQA and QRECC datasets show that\nSynRewrite consistently outperforms human rewrites in both retrieval and\ngeneration tasks.

Another challenge\nis the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text\nembeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To\novercome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model\narchitecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and\nSemantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM\nincorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph\nEncoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then,\nthe Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to\nunderstand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a\ndetailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of\nKGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available\nat https://github.com/yfangZhang/SSKG-LLM.",

To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark\nfor vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is\ndistinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task\ninputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any\ncode or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.\nFeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a\nfully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data\ncontamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass\n(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent\nregressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes\nrepositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.\nWe evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on\nFeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe\ncoding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of\nonly 29.94%.

Therefore, we present\nthe first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library\nhallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate six diverse LLMs across two\nhallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library\nmember hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how\nrealistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of\nvarying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake\nnames/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic\nvulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger\nhallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to\n99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of\ntasks.

A detailed logical database model is proposed, designed for\ncomprehensive analysis that combines financial sales metrics with behavioral\npatterns of customer movement. The article also analyzes the expected business\nbenefits of RFID implementation through the lens of the Balanced Scorecard\n(BSC), which evaluates financial performance, customer satisfaction, and\ninternal process optimization.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through\nin-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of\nthese approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many\ndemonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.\nMapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter\nparameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored\ngenerating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need\nto integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce\nCompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter\nparameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be\nmerged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved\npassages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.\nCritically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,\nrobustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution\nwhen input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes\ninformation into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery\nof input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical\nresults on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show\nthat CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when\nscaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a\npractical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.",

Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single\ngreedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and\nverifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable\nspeedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training\nwith the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree\nReward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of\nthe draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;\n(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that\ncontrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming\ndebiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along\nthe longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that\nincreasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and\nspeedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and\nmultiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and\nyields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3.

        "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle\ncomplex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's\nverbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors\nacross long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework\nthat aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency\nof explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small\nset of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution\nsteps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the\nInformation Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be\napproximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via\na low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is\nencouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an\nauxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully\nrepresent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground\nthe latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of\nuninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency,\naccuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of\nreasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks.

As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal\nrole in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties.\nDespite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in\naddressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs),\nsuch as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to\ntheir inherent limitations.

        "abstract": "Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in neural information\nretrieval, offering an alternative to dense retrieval (DR) by directly\ngenerating identifiers of relevant documents. In this paper, we theoretically\nand empirically investigate how GR fundamentally diverges from DR in both\nlearning objectives and representational capacity. GR performs globally\nnormalized maximum-likelihood optimization and encodes corpus and relevance\ninformation directly in the model parameters, whereas DR adopts locally\nnormalized objectives and represents the corpus with external embeddings before\ncomputing similarity via a bilinear interaction. Our analysis suggests that,\nunder scaling, GR can overcome the inherent limitations of DR, yielding two\nmajor benefits. First, with larger corpora, GR avoids the sharp performance\ndegradation caused by the optimization drift induced by DR's local\nnormalization. Second, with larger models, GR's representational capacity\nscales with parameter size, unconstrained by the global low-rank structure that\nlimits DR. We validate these theoretical insights through controlled\nexperiments on the Natural Questions and MS MARCO datasets, across varying\nnegative sampling strategies, embedding dimensions, and model scales. But\ndespite its theoretical advantages, GR does not universally outperform DR in\npractice. We outline directions to bridge the gap between GR's theoretical\npotential and practical performance, providing guidance for future research in\nscalable and robust generative retrieval.",

        "abstract": "Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently\ncomplex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying\ndiverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including\nreasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on\nfact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and\nnumerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects,\nand are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is\nunable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and\nbacktracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore\nscaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex\nnumerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM.\nWe train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible\nreasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We\nobserve that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to\nsignificant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve\ncompute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS\nselectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach\nachieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable\n18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods.

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward\nmodels (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation.\nPrevious studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by\noptimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as\nsupervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving\ncapabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a\nsignificant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically,\nthe solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make\ncorrect judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of\nsolving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to\naddress this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the\nsolving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision,\nexplicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during\nmodel optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%,\nthereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J\nachieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base\nmodel while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J\naccomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful\nexternal models for distillation.",

Results show that (i) current agents\nstruggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent\nsupported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions,\n(ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce\nvulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding\nexplicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure\ncoding, underscoring the need for further research.

        "abstract": "Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on\nlow-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix\nin a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient\nstrategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a\nnoticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression\nvia Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework\nthat replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse\nfactorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense\ndictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a\nunion-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight\nmatrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected\ndictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant\nbasis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the\nfactorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers\nclosely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional\nreconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware\nstrategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under\nreasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity\nallows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with\npost-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate\nCoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group\nsettings at 20-50\\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority\nover state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and\nperplexity.

Here, we challenge this\nbelief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent\nlimitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature\nof the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each\nsample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first\npipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces\ninterference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply\nrestoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)\npipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness\nfor model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from\nsuboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through\nsystematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and\neffective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework.\nExtensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that\nLocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our\nknowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x\nbeyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities.

This in turn\nhampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a\npervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981).

However, ranking involves selecting a recommendation list from a\ncombinatorially large space. Simply enlarging the candidate set remains\nineffective, and performance gains quickly saturate.

        "abstract": "Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in\ncomplex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the\ninference stage with a \"thinking longer\" paradigm. Even as the foundational\nreasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a\nmodel's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often\nrevealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity\nbetween its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present\nA2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge\nthe gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this\nframework, an \"explorer\" model first generates potential solutions in parallel\nthrough repeated sampling. Subsequently,a \"synthesizer\" model integrates these\nreferences for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage\nprocess allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential\nmethods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a\nplug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's\ncapabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the\nQwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its\nself-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the\nexplorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling\nparadigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a \"small-to-big\" variant that\ncombines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration\nsurpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly\n30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a\nperformance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for\nreal-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual\nresponses, so-called \"hallucination\" problems. Existing methods for detecting\nand alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the\ninternal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the\nLLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external\nresources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the\ncornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a\nsimple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the\nbehavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis\nreveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual\nresponses while non-consistent responses vice versa.

        "abstract": "Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world\nvision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of\nvision tokens. With the advent of \"thinking with images\" models, reasoning now\nextends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our\ntwo-stage \"coarse-to-fine\" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is\nanalyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are\ncropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This\napproach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual\ndetails where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are\ntruly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first\nstage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where\nclear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this\nissue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs\nreasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to\nfocus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped\nregion to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,\nwe develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning\nframework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach\ndelivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with\ngreater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*\nbenchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a\n3x inference speedup.

        "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across\na wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations\nremains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study\nof the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key\nvisual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a\ncarefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often\nproduce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental\nlimitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that\nthis phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably\nperceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the\nunbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In\nparticular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,\nintroduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at\ndifferent positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To\nmitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple\nyet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image\ntokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive\nexperiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without\nretraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal\nbenchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of\ninformation flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more\nholistic visual understanding.",

These issues\nhinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment\npractice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM\nframework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent\nREcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant\ncomponents from student responses and encodes them into a structured\nrepresentation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then\nused to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that\nmodel reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing\ninterpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark\ndatasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs\n(GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics,\nAutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK,\ncorrelations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent\nbaselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional\nrubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results\ndemonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent\ndesign offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated\nscoring.",

However,\ncontrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that\nperformance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the\nnumber of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems\nfrom a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we\nintroduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that\nenables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference\nwithout incurring additional training overhead.

Facing\npotential system prompt leakage risks, model developers have implemented\nstrategies to prevent leakage, primarily by disabling LLMs from repeating their\ncontext when encountering known attack patterns. However, it remains vulnerable\nto new and unforeseen prompt-leaking techniques. In this paper, we first\nintroduce a simple yet effective prompt leaking attack to reveal such risks.\nOur attack is capable of extracting system prompts from various LLM-based\napplication, even from SOTA LLM models such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our\nfindings further inspire us to search for a fundamental solution to the\nproblems by having no system prompt in the context.

By doing so, SysVec minimizes the risk of\nunauthorized disclosure while preserving the LLM's core language capabilities.\nRemarkably, this approach not only enhances security but also improves the\nmodel's general instruction-following abilities.

        "abstract": "Model integrity of Large language models (LLMs) has become a pressing\nsecurity concern with their massive online deployment. Prior Bit-Flip Attacks\n(BFAs) -- a class of popular AI weight memory fault-injection techniques -- can\nseverely compromise Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): as few as tens of bit flips\ncan degrade accuracy toward random guessing. Recent studies extend BFAs to LLMs\nand reveal that, despite the intuition of better robustness from modularity and\nredundancy, only a handful of adversarial bit flips can also cause LLMs'\ncatastrophic accuracy degradation. However, existing BFA methods typically\nfocus on either integer or floating-point models separately, limiting attack\nflexibility. Moreover, in floating-point models, random bit flips often cause\nperturbed parameters to extreme values (e.g., flipping in exponent bit), making\nit not stealthy and leading to numerical runtime error (e.g., invalid tensor\nvalues (NaN/Inf)). In this work, for the first time, we propose SBFA (Sneaky\nBit-Flip Attack), which collapses LLM performance with only one single bit flip\nwhile keeping perturbed values within benign layer-wise weight distribution. It\nis achieved through iterative searching and ranking through our defined\nparameter sensitivity metric, ImpactScore, which combines gradient sensitivity\nand perturbation range constrained by the benign layer-wise weight\ndistribution. A novel lightweight SKIP searching algorithm is also proposed to\ngreatly reduce searching complexity, which leads to successful SBFA searching\ntaking only tens of minutes for SOTA LLMs. Across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma\nmodels, with only one single bit flip, SBFA successfully degrades accuracy to\nbelow random levels on MMLU and SST-2 in both BF16 and INT8 data formats.\nRemarkably, flipping a single bit out of billions of parameters reveals a\nsevere security concern of SOTA LLM models.",

To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level\nconsensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable\ndeferral.

A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the\nfused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To\nensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental\nvariable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly\nrecombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation.\nExtensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and\nsarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of\nCaMIB.

Unlike existing approaches that treat audio\nas static input, TwS enables models to actively think with audio signals,\nperforming numerical analysis and digital manipulation through multimodal\nreasoning. To evaluate this approach, we construct MELD-Hard1k, a new\nrobustness benchmark created by introducing various acoustic perturbations.\nExperiments reveal that state-of-the-art LALMs suffer dramatic performance\ndegradation on MELD-Hard1k, with accuracy dropping by more than $50\\%$ compared\nto clean audio. TwS achieves substantial improvements in robustness,\ndemonstrating both effectiveness and scalability: small models gain $24.73\\%$\nabsolute accuracy, with improvements scaling consistently up to $36.61\\%$ for\nlarger models. Our findings demonstrate that Audio CoT can significantly\nenhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing\nmore robust audio understanding systems.",

However, it remains challenging\nto use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),\nwhere the output must continually update as the input context expands, while\nstill maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency\nrequirement.\n  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous\ntranslation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference\nparadigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a\nconsistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a\ndraft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the\noutput will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance\nrate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but\nalso leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the\npoint of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end\ncondition is met.\n  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the\nneed for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play\nsolution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.\nExperimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate\nthat our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional\nauto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the\nimportant paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external\nknowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While\ngraph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,\nthey face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge\ngraphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted\ngraphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM\nextractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper\npresents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces\nMulti-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these\nlimitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of\na Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly\nincorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving\nSub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical\nlimitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static\ngraph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A\nmulti-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser\nagents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,\nanswer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and\nsubgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively\nbuild a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent\ndrawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise\nreasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning\nbenchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of\nMACER framework.",

This bottleneck is substantial; for\ninstance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of\n4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's\nweights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising\ndirection, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that\nperforms poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that\nnot all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial\nfirst and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors\nfor attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies\nlow-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's\nalgorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a\ncomprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates\nduring decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving\ncontext. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention\nmodules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or\neven improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,\nOjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require\ncomplex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in\ndynamically tracking context shifts.

However, the prevalence of fraudulent reviews undermines\nthis trust by potentially misleading consumers and damaging the reputations of\nthe sellers. This research addresses this pressing issue by employing advanced\nbig data analytics and machine learning approaches on a substantial dataset of\nAmazon product reviews. The primary objective is to detect and classify spam\nreviews accurately so that it enhances the authenticity of the review.

        "abstract": "This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art\nmultilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and\npuns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on\nexisting LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise\ngrammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural\nappropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for\nreal-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.\n  To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87\nLLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional\ndialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language\nprovided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the\noriginal's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while\nleading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally\nnuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring\nsubstantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages,\ndespite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated\nfigurative expressions and wordplay.\n  This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable\npredictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural\nappropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area\ncurrently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a\nproof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI\nsystems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support\nthe opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable\ninsights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in\nculturally diverse contexts.",

        "abstract": "The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied\nagents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon\nones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations,\nlong-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning\nthe role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs\ntranslate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like\nthe Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver\nto derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research\non VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications\nsuch as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In\nthis work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle\none-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those\non an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time\naccount for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We\nconclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation.\nWe reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail\nto capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating\nintermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs\npartially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves\nheadroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.",

Practitioners and researchers\nface a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models\ndraft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this\nchoice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which\nproduces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite),\nwhich adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four\npopular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that\nweigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off\nbetween coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of\nattribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage\nwith competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods\nprioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed.

However, recent Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when\nprocessing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this\nissue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \\emph{interactive search task}, where the\nVLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At\neach step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial\nrelations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the\ntarget conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the\nrendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its\npredictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI\ngrounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning\nwith a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show\nthat GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy\nand achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\\% \\rightarrow\n93.9\\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\\% \\rightarrow 56.5\\%$).

However, these approaches invariably sample\ndiscrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional\ninformation in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.\nWhile preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven\nbeneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily\nconstraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To\naddress this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in\nRLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G\napproaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture\nembeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate\ndirectly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.\nEvaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive\nlanguage tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements\n(5--35 \\% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the\nQwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of\ntrajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive\nhidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's\nbenefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy\nthroughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image\nartificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural\ninaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We\nanalyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse\nSaudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated\neach image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,\nbackground and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior\nresearcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding\n10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,\nwith ImageFX outputs being 85\\% male, Grok 86.6\\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\\%\nmale, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender\nstereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical\nroles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted\nactivities were frequently observed across all three models.\nCounter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations\nrather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models\nmirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,\noffering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics\nand cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more\ndiverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation\nframeworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.",

        "abstract": "Moral alignment has emerged as a widely adopted approach for regulating the\nbehavior of pretrained language models (PLMs), typically through fine-tuning or\nmodel editing on curated datasets. However, this process often comes at the\ncost of degraded downstream task performance. Prior studies commonly aim to\nachieve a performance trade-off by encouraging PLMs to selectively forget\nstereotypical knowledge through carefully designed fairness objectives, while\npreserving their helpfulness. In this short paper, we investigate the\nunderlying mechanisms of the performance trade-off in the context of mitigating\ngender stereotypes, through the lens of forgetting and the fairness objective.\nOur analysis reveals the limitations of current fairness objective in achieving\ntrade-off by demonstrating that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily\ndriven by the overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes\ntends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating\nforgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve\ndownstream task performance.",

        "abstract": "Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly\nused metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of\nhuman judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is\ncostly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or\nmultimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video\nunderstanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce\nVideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from\nvideo understanding models (\\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on\nvideos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a\ngenerator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses\nconditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's\nrating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,\nVideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B\nand 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than\nMLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve\nperformance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation\nof video understanding tasks.",
