        "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are\ntraditionally evaluated in static, \"frozen world\" settings: model responses are\nassumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be\nimmutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for\nshort-term tasks, the \"frozen world\" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning\ntasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think\nthrough problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model\nstarts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the\nfrozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic\nscenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs\non a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to\nin-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require\nlong-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:\neven state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can\nfail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with\nperformance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the\nreasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,\nincluding reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final\nanswer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon\nreasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where\nperformance degrades while incorporating updated information.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also\neffectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design\nprinciples and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning\nin agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and\nreasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic\ntrajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger\nSFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration\nand markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are\ncrucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and\nmaintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency.\n(iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool\ncalls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy.\nTogether, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and\ntraining efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with\nsmaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL\nresearch. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a\nhigh-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL\ndataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the\nagentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including\nAIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes,\n4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance\ncompared to 32B-sized models. Code and models:\nhttps://github.com/Gen-Verse/Open-AgentRL",

While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning\ncapabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and\nlong rollout durations.

Beyond efficiency, our findings show that\nquantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and\nenabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize\nexploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,\nwhich dynamically adjusts noise during training.

        "abstract": "Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising\nresults, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain\nunderexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based\napproaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative\npretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals\nwithin a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through\nanalysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm\nthat latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve\nas a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a\nLanguage-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its\neffectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.\nFurthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),\nshowing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive\nrefinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This\nsuggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm\nfor enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of\nGRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on\nits representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource\nvisual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining\nbefore CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding\ncapabilities.

While existing methods\napproximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via\ncustomized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all\nMC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms\nin the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint\nrestricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations\nand ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose \\emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient\nRL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the\nELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key\nproperties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term\ndepends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation\nacross samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the\nvalue and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based\nobjective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for\nthe original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC\nsample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved\nRL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.\nExperiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for\ndLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.",

However, existing approaches\ntypically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which\noften leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off\ncourse due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for\nsmaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we\nanalyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning\nand execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from\nincorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan\nAggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan\nexploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on\nthe token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them\ninto a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design\nin which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA\nmodule implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that\noutcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K\ntokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level\npreference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo\n(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields\nmore efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive\nexperiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks\ndemonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method\noutperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward\nRL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale\nlanguage models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ\nstatic strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of\nstudent models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and\napply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer.\nTo address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge\nDistillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to\nthe real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic\nmodules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven\nAdaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation\nfocus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating\ncomputational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase.\nSecond, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a\ncounterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low\ntemperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high\ntemperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's\ncomplete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a\nplug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of\nvarious distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their\ndot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design\nprinciples: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token\ninteractions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to\neach input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus\nsoftmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states\n(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of\nthese principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically\ndeconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax\nthese principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid\narchitectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical\nanalysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their\nabsence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical\nform and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when\npreserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in\nisolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard\nattention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our\nunderstanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new\navenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.",

While effective for some complex queries, RAR remains\nvulnerable to errors and misleading outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)\noffers methods to estimate the confidence of systems' outputs. These methods,\nhowever, often handle simple queries with no retrieval or single-step\nretrieval, without properly handling RAR setup. Accurate estimation of UQ for\nRAR requires accounting for all sources of uncertainty, including those arising\nfrom retrieval and generation. In this paper, we account for all these sources\nand introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Consistency (R2C)--a novel UQ\nmethod for RAR. The core idea of R2C is to perturb the multi-step reasoning\nprocess by applying various actions to reasoning steps. These perturbations\nalter the retriever's input, which shifts its output and consequently modifies\nthe generator's input at the next step. Through this iterative feedback loop,\nthe retriever and generator continuously reshape one another's inputs, enabling\nus to capture uncertainty arising from both components.

Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques\nthat require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL\nthat strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility\nboundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour.

We demonstrate that cold-start recommenders not only mirror the\npopularity biases of warm models, but are in fact affected more severely:\nbecause they cannot infer popularity from interaction data, they instead\nattempt to estimate it based solely on content features.

        "abstract": "Social deduction games like Werewolf combine language, reasoning, and\nstrategy, providing a testbed for studying natural language and social\nintelligence. However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play,\nyielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of\nsocial gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival\ntime or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To\naddress these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal\nWerewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens,\nand 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel\nstrategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies\nas ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as\nmultiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate\nstances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation,\nwhich assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This\nframework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning\ncapabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent\ngameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse\nperformance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in\ndeception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires\nresearch on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.",

While traditional retrieval focuses on\nrelevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,\ni.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and\ncomprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic\nattribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from\nthe same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension\nability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion\nof LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple\ndatasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal\nfor LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across\ndifferent LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the\nLLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some\nhuman-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific\nLLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for\nLLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,\nwe propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We\nevaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while\nverbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to\nassess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and\nto select truly useful ones for unknown queries.",

(2) What form do these mechanisms\ntake? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first\nconstruct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit\ncomparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract\ncontext-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context\nencoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally\nimplement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal\nanalysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement\ninterventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the\nmodel's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local\ncomponents into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional\nexpression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65%\nemotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and\nsteering-based methods (Q3).

        "abstract": "In recent years, affiliate marketing has emerged as a revenue-sharing\nstrategy where merchants collaborate with promoters to promote their products.\nIt not only increases product exposure but also allows promoters to earn a\ncommission. This paper addresses the pivotal yet under-explored challenge in\naffiliate marketing: accurately assessing and predicting the contributions of\npromoters in product promotion. We design a novel metric for evaluating the\nindirect contributions of the promoter, called propagation scale.\nUnfortunately, existing time series forecasting techniques fail to deliver\naccurate predictions due to the propagation scale being influenced by multiple\nfactors and the inherent complexities arising from dynamic scenarios. To\naddress this issue, we decouple the network structure from the node signals and\npropose a two-stage solution: initially, the basic self-sales and network\nstructure prediction are conducted separately, followed by the synthesis of the\npropagation scale. Specifically, we design a graph convolution encoding scheme\nbased on descendant neighbors and incorporate hypergraph convolution to\nefficiently capture complex promotional dynamics. Additionally, three auxiliary\ntasks are employed: self-sales prediction for base estimations, descendant\nprediction to synthesize propagation scale, and promoter activation prediction\nto mitigate high volatility issues. Extensive offline experiments on\nlarge-scale industrial datasets validate the superiority of our method.

Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy\nOptimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information\n(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn\noptimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry\ndrift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower\nbound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes\nthese policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the\nselection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior\nto training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles\npredict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO\nablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates\ndesirable structural change in the manifold.

        "abstract": "Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,\nwhere emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing\napproaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to\ngeneralize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose\nEvaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time\nfake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process\naccording to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a\nsequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)\nEvidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into\ndecision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)\nReasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is\nadequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates\nsentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the\naccuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo\nlabels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge\nthrough interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the\nevaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable\nevaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.\nMoreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news\nfor evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves\ngeneralization to real-time news.

Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing\ntheory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing\nthe alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream\ntasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in\nsome cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks,\nindicating low ecological validity.

In this work,\nwe introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a\ncontrolled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual\nquestions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex\nqueries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic\nmisalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries.

        "title": "Can Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Generalize Across Diverse Domains?",
        "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of\ntool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of\nan LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively\ntrained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training\ndomain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning\ndomains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical\ntasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,\nenabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this\ncross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning\n(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill\nmigration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts\ndomain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,\nfostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system\nthat decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool\nefficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across\ndomain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,\ntool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and\ncoherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse\nbenchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and\nhighlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.",

In this work, we propose\nELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and\nFloat8 data types.

While\nresearch on hate speech detection has progressed, it remains largely focused on\nEnglish, resulting in limited resources and benchmarks for low-resource\nlanguages. Moreover, many of these languages have multiple linguistic\nvarieties, a factor often overlooked in current approaches. At the same time,\nlarge language models require substantial amounts of data to perform reliably,\na requirement that low-resource languages often cannot meet. In this work, we\naddress these gaps by compiling a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for\nEuropean Spanish, standardised with unified labels and metadata. This\ncollection is based on a systematic analysis and integration of existing\nresources, aiming to bridge the data gap and support more consistent and\nscalable hate speech detection. We extended this collection by translating it\ninto European Portuguese and into a Galician standard that is more convergent\nwith Spanish and another Galician variant that is more convergent with\nPortuguese, creating aligned multilingual corpora. Using these resources, we\nestablish new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages.

This method provides numerous benefits,\nincluding fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed\nto zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training\nin such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information\nretrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text\ninstance is \"similar\" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label\nis determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art\nsentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text\ninstance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary\nclassification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon\nprevious literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and\nevaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based\nclassification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the\nsemantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,\nand label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic\nmulti-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity\ndistributions show statistically significant differences across models,\ndatasets and even label sets.

Our label-specific\nthresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5\nthresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work\nby an average of 14%.

        "abstract": "Query-service relevance prediction in e-commerce search systems faces strict\nlatency requirements that prevent the direct application of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage reasoning\ndistillation framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a powerful\nteacher LLM to a lightweight, deployment-friendly student model. In the first\nstage, we address the limitations of general-purpose LLMs by constructing a\ndomain-adapted teacher model. This is achieved through a three-step process:\ndomain-adaptive pre-training to inject platform knowledge, supervised\nfine-tuning to elicit reasoning skills, and preference optimization with a\nmulti-dimensional reward model to ensure the generation of reliable and\npreference-aligned reasoning paths. This teacher can then automatically\nannotate massive query-service pairs from search logs with both relevance\nlabels and reasoning chains. In the second stage, to address the challenges of\narchitectural heterogeneity in standard distillation, we introduce Contrastive\nReasoning Self-Distillation (CRSD). By modeling the behavior of the same\nstudent model under \"standard\" and \"reasoning-augmented\" inputs as a\nteacher-student relationship, CRSD enables the lightweight model to internalize\nthe teacher's complex decision-making mechanisms without needing the explicit\nreasoning path at inference. Offline evaluations and online A/B testing in the\nMeituan search advertising system demonstrate that our framework achieves\nsignificant improvements across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness\nand practical value.",

We introduce Latent\nRefinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a\nPredictive Feedback Loop.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), owing to their extensive open-domain knowledge\nand semantic reasoning capabilities, have been increasingly integrated into\nrecommender systems (RS). However, a substantial gap remains between the\npre-training objectives of LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation\ntasks. To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed\non specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their\npredictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it\ninduces Language Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens-such\nas task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens-while underutilizing core user\ninteraction tokens that encode user-specific preferences. This bias not only\nundermines recommendation accuracy but also raises unfairness concerns.\n  To address this issue, we propose Group Distributionally Robust\nOptimization-based Tuning (GDRT), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that enforces\nconsistent model performance across token groups with varying degrees of\nrelevance to auxiliary tokens. By adaptively upweighting underperforming\ngroups, typically those weakly correlated with auxiliary tokens, GDRT shifts\nthe model's attention from superficial auxiliary cues to informative user\ninteraction tokens, thereby mitigating language bias. Extensive experiments\nconducted on three public datasets demonstrate that GDRT effectively mitigates\nlanguage bias, yielding substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy\n(with an average NDCG@10 gain of 24.29%) and significantly enhancing\nrecommendation fairness.",

However, standard SFT uniformly penalizes all tokens,\nneglecting that only a small subset of critical tokens determines reasoning\ncorrectness. This uniform supervision often causes reduced output diversity and\nlimited generalization. We propose Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT), a simple\nyet effective approach that updates only tokens identified as functionally\nindispensable via counterfactual perturbations. By focusing gradient signals on\nthese decisive reasoning steps while preserving the diversity of non-critical\ntokens, CFT can enhance both generation and diversity. Extensive experiments on\nfive models across three families (Qwen, OLMo, LLaMA) and eleven mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks show that CFT, despite fine-tuning on less than 12% of\ntokens, consistently outperforms standard SFT. Moreover, CFT enables test-time\nscaling through improved sampling diversity and provides a stronger\ninitialization for reinforcement learning, sustaining performance gains in\nlater training stages while maintaining higher entropy for better exploration.\nThese results highlight CFT as a practical and general framework for efficient\nand robust LLM fine-tuning.",

LLMs have demonstrated remarkable\npotential in inferring users' nuanced preferences through fine-grained semantic\nreasoning. However, they also exhibit a notable limitation in effectively\nmodeling collaborative signals, i.e., behavioral correlations inherent in\nusers' historical interactions. Our empirical analysis further reveals that the\nattention mechanisms in LLMs tend to disproportionately focus on tokens within\nthe same item, thereby impeding the capture of cross-item correlations.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a novel hierarchical attention masking\nstrategy for LLM-based recommendation, termed HatLLM. Specifically, in shallow\nlayers, HatLLM masks attention between tokens from different items,\nfacilitating intra-item semantic understanding; in contrast, in deep layers,\nHatLLM masks attention within items, thereby compelling the model to capture\ncross-item correlations. This progressive, layer-wise approach enables LLMs to\njointly model both token-level and item-level dependencies.

We then leverage a large-scale\ndataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare\nevaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of\npeople and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative\nqueries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These\nqueries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI\nevaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to\nquantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to\npeople in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.\nHowever, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to\ngame-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more\n\"jaggedness\" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater\ndifficulty of quantifying this query.

The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine\nmechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of\neach span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes\ncriss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At\nthe inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each\nentity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all\nvalid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags.

To address this\nissue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis\nstrategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create\ndata tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.\nSpecifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a\nquery-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher\nresponse quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned\nprompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate\nthen Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for\nthe entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive\nexperiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn\nconsistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in\ninstruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the\neffectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.",

Safety mechanisms,\nwhile essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline\nbenign requests out of excessive caution.

This setting\nintroduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is\nharmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content.

The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign\nparts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful\nelements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal\nbenchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18\nVLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under\nsemantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room\nfor improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models\naverage 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%.

VeritasFi enhances financial QA through\nthree key innovations: (1) A multi-modal preprocessing pipeline that seamlessly\ntransforms heterogeneous data into a coherent, machine-readable format. (2) A\ntripartite hybrid retrieval engine that operates in parallel, combining deep\nmulti-path retrieval over a semantically indexed document corpus, real-time\ndata acquisition through tool utilization, and an expert-curated memory bank\nfor high-frequency questions, ensuring comprehensive scope, accuracy, and\nefficiency.

        "abstract": "Systematic reviews are crucial for synthesizing scientific evidence but\nremain labor-intensive, especially when extracting detailed methodological\ninformation. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating\nmethodological assessments, promising to transform evidence synthesis. Here,\nusing causal mediation analysis as a representative methodological domain, we\nbenchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180\nfull-text scientific articles. Model performance closely correlated with human\njudgments (accuracy correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving\nnear-human accuracy on straightforward, explicitly stated methodological\ncriteria. However, accuracy sharply declined on complex, inference-intensive\nassessments, lagging expert reviewers by up to 15%. Errors commonly resulted\nfrom superficial linguistic cues -- for instance, models frequently\nmisinterpreted keywords like \"longitudinal\" or \"sensitivity\" as automatic\nevidence of rigorous methodological approache, leading to systematic\nmisclassifications. Longer documents yielded lower model accuracy, whereas\npublication year showed no significant effect. Our findings highlight an\nimportant pattern for practitioners using LLMs for methods review and synthesis\nfrom full texts: current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological\nfeatures but require human oversight for nuanced interpretations. Integrating\nautomated information extraction with targeted expert review thus provides a\npromising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in evidence\nsynthesis across diverse scientific fields.",

Historical interaction sequences\noften contain irrelevant noisy items, which significantly hinders the\nperformance of recommendation systems.

        "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) models often capture user preferences based on\nthe historically interacted item IDs, which usually obtain sub-optimal\nperformance when the interaction history is limited. Content-based sequential\nrecommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits\nitems' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning. However,\nthere are still three key challenges: (i) how to reduce the semantic gap\nbetween different content modality representations; (ii) how to jointly model\nuser behavior preferences and content preferences; and (iii) how to design an\neffective training strategy to align ID representations and content\nrepresentations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model,\nself-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment,\nnamed SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and\ndevelop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality\nrepresentations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential\nmodel, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior\npreferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content\npreferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic\nrelationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a\ntwo-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to\nalign modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the\ntraining process of content modality dependency and item collaborative\ndependency. Extensive experiments conducted on four public video streaming\ndatasets demonstrate our SICSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art ID-modality\nsequential recommenders and content-modality sequential recommenders by 8.04%\non NDCG@5 and 6.62% on NDCD@10 on average, respectively.",

Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully\ncapture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination\ndetection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions.

In real-world\nplatforms, the creation behaviors of content creators plays a crucial role in\nshaping long-term welfare beyond short-term recommendation accuracy, making the\neffective steering of creator behavior essential to foster a healthier RS\necosystem. Existing works typically rely on re-ranking algorithms that\nheuristically adjust item exposure to steer creators' behavior. However, when\nembedded within recommendation pipelines, such a strategy often conflicts with\nthe short-term objective of improving recommendation accuracy, leading to\nperformance degradation and suboptimal long-term welfare. The well-established\neconomics studies offer us valuable insights for an alternative approach\nwithout relying on recommendation algorithmic design: revealing information\nfrom an information-rich party (sender) to a less-informed party (receiver) can\neffectively change the receiver's beliefs and steer their behavior. Inspired by\nthis idea, we propose an information-revealing framework, named Long-term\nWelfare Optimization via Information Revelation (LoRe). In this framework, we\nutilize a classical information revelation method (i.e., Bayesian persuasion)\nto map the stakeholders in RS, treating the platform as the sender and creators\nas the receivers. To address the challenge posed by the unrealistic assumption\nof traditional economic methods, we formulate the process of information\nrevelation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a learning algorithm\ntrained and inferred in environments with boundedly rational creators.\nExtensive experiments on two real-world RS datasets demonstrate that our method\ncan effectively outperform existing fair re-ranking methods and information\nrevealing strategies in improving long-term user welfare.",

In this\nwork, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces\ncomputational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.\nSpecifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using\nonly 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies\nin the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in\nreasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the\nretention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and\nPass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and\nchallenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and\ngenerality of our method.

        "abstract": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications\nhas introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security\nchallenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic\ninterpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data\nrepresentations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box\njailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the\nsecurity measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that\nrely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic,\ntwo-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to\nempirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2\nleverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious\njailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a\nmore nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate\nsuperior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world\nrelevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial\nmodels, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting\na rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA\nGuard and Azure's content filters.

In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise\nfrom failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object\nentities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we\nassess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks,\nand find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all\nstudied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting\nin inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two\neffective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts\nacross languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy\nand consistency.

        "title": "Large Language Model Sourcing: A Survey",
        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized\nartificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g.,\nrecognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning,\ndecision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications\nspanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare,\nfinance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due\nto the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated\ncontent, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright\ninfringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing\ninformation from multiple perspectives is essential.\n  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for\ncontent generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that\ntogether capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model\nperspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish\ncontent generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model\nStructure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing\narchitectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data\nperspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing\nthe origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In\ncontrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying\nexternal information used to support or influence the responses of model.\nMoreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing\nsourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and\nposterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these\ndimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of\nLLMs deployment in real-world applications.",

It plays a crucial role in determining the\nfinal exposure, directly influencing user experience. Recently, generative\nreranking has gained increasing attention for its strong ability to model\ncomplex dependencies among items. However, most existing methods suffer from\nthe \"likelihood trap\", where high-likelihood sequences are often perceived as\nlow-quality by humans. These models tend to repeatedly recommend a set of\nhigh-frequency items, resulting in list homogeneity, thereby limiting user\nengagement. In this work, we propose Consistent Graph-structured Generative\nRecommendation (Congrats), a novel generative reranking framework. To break the\nlikelihood trap, we introduce a novel graph-structured decoder that can capture\ndiverse sequences along multiple paths. This design not only expands the\ndecoding space to promote diversity, but also improves prediction accuracy by\nimplicit item dependencies derived from vertex transitions. Furthermore, we\ndesign a differentiable cascade system that incorporates an evaluator, enabling\nthe model to learn directly from user preferences as the training objective.\nExtensive offline experiments validate the superior performance of Congrats\nover state-of-the-art reranking methods. Moreover, Congrats has been evaluated\non a large-scale video-sharing app, Kuaishou, with over 300 million daily\nactive users, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves both\nrecommendation quality and diversity, validating our effectiveness in practical\nindustrial environments.",

This new paradigm of graph\nconstruction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token\nconsumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original\npassages.

We demonstrate, both\ntheoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response\nsimilarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of\n$\\lambda\\,\\Delta\\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation\nbetween preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.\n  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along\nwith an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess\nreal-world and adversarial preference alignment.\n  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates\npluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial\nrobustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation\ndemonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding\nsubstantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6\nResponse-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity\nand +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention\nConsistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.",

In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language\nmodel tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter\nscale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively\ntackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal\nknowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To\naddress these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset\ncontaining 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on\nthis, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the\nperformance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable\ndecision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we\nalso introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate\nmodels across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates\nstrong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar\nscale and achieving performance on par with the much larger\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%).

In contrast,\nconvolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size\nlimits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,\nwe introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification\ncapability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of\nconvolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the\nnumber of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational\nresources.

Despite early-stage safeguards enabled\nby alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored\nvulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned\npaths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this\nphenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral\ntriggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven\nreasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where\nsurface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain\nescalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe\ncompletions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift\nInduction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming,\nand condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates,\nwhile their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks,\nwe propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution\ncorrection and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues).

To handle complex or compound\nqueries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query\nexpansion through reinforcement learning.

        "abstract": "While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate,\ncausing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful\nmeme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus\nhas been dedicated to \\textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights\nfrom philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized\nby two essential features: a \\textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of\n\\textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \\textbf{PCM}\nfor modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims,\nwe introduce the \\textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and\nharnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce\n\\textbf{\\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to\ncapture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while\ndemonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.",

However, despite their ability to\ngenerate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries,\nintroducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing\nmitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive\nlearning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address\nthe diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we\ninvestigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans\nin generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set\nof source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use\nGPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging\nthese annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and\nannotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries\nwith span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to\nimprove the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent,\nunlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that\nall three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve\nfaithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.",

We find that this\nfailure is potentially attributed to a limitation of existing preference\nlearning: it emphasizes selecting the correct response for a given prompt,\nwhile neglecting counterfactual prompts that should alter the response.\n  To address this limitation, we propose abductive preference learning, a\nfine-tuning paradigm that reverses the conventional conditioning by learning\npreferences over prompts given a response. To validate this idea, we construct\nan abductive dataset derived from the HaluEval QA benchmark with 1,001 entries,\nimplementing abductive DPO and its variant DPOP. Experiments reveal\ncomplementary strengths: standard methods improve response selection, abductive\nmethods improve prompt discrimination, while a multitask objective unifies\nboth. On the abductive dataset, multitask DPOP boosts accuracy from $90.0\\%$ to\n$99.5\\%$ in response selection and $54.7\\%$ to $85.0\\%$ in prompt\ndiscrimination, with qualitative evidence highlighting improved sensitivity to\nprompt differences.

Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly\nemerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of\nbetter data efficiency and free of the \"reversal curse\" in pre-training.\nHowever, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training\nphase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through\nfine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,\nevaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to\nprobe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that\narLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA\ngeneralization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order\nmatches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward\nand backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal\ngains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked\nfine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This\nproposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of\narLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.",
