        "title": "On The Role of Pretrained Language Models in General-Purpose Text Embeddings: A Survey",
        "abstract": "Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness\nacross a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as\nretrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With\nthe emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text\nembeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce\nrich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically\nleverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized\nthrough contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey,\nwe provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the\nroles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental\narchitecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding\nextraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives,\nand data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such\nas multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and\nscenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research\ndirections that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking\nintegration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information\nincorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to\nserve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers\nseeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant\nefficiency advantages over manual ad text creation.

        "abstract": "This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the\nKDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn\n(CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of\nmodern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate,\nespecially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex,\nmulti-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world\napplications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual\naccuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust,\nmulti-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over\ncompleteness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for\nefficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways\ngeneration and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed\nto minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's\nscoring metric.

        "abstract": "Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) has become a quintessential\nalgorithmic problem for various other foundational data tasks for AI workloads.\nGraph-based ANNS indexes have superb empirical trade-offs in indexing cost,\nquery efficiency, and query approximation quality. Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse\ndatasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at\nleast as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding\ndata. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of\nqueries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x\nthroughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets. To the best of our\nknowledge, CleANN is the first concurrent ANNS index to achieve such efficiency\nwhile maintaining quality under full dynamism.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources\nduring generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates\nthis process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows\nlinearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a\nbottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques,\nincluding token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been\nproposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This\npaper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages\nthe observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the\nremoval of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction\nusually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under\nhigh compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{CaliDrop}, a\nnovel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our\npreliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high\nsimilarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative\ncalibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by\ntoken eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly\nimproves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.",

        "abstract": "In traditional graph retrieval tools, graph matching is commonly used to\nretrieve desired graphs from extensive graph datasets according to their\nstructural similarities. However, in real applications, graph nodes have\nnumerous attributes which also contain valuable information for evaluating\nsimilarities between graphs.

We propose a novel framework\nfor interactive visual graph matching. In the proposed framework, an\nattribute-structure synchronization method is developed for representing\nstructural and attribute features in a unified embedding space based on\nCanonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). To support fast and interactive matching,\n\\revise{our method} provides users with intuitive visual query interfaces for\ntraversing, filtering and searching for the target graph in the embedding space\nconveniently. With the designed interfaces, the users can also specify a new\ntarget graph with desired structural and semantic features.

Currently, the most popular and high-performing SBR methods primarily\nleverage graph neural networks (GNNs), which model session sequences as\ngraph-structured data to effectively capture user intent. However, most\nGNNs-based SBR methods primarily focus on modeling the ID sequence information\nof session sequences, while neglecting the rich semantic information embedded\nwithin them. This limitation significantly hampers model's ability to\naccurately infer users' true intention. To address above challenge, this paper\nproposes a novel SBR approach called Integrating LLM-Derived Multi-Semantic\nIntent into Graph Model for Session-based Recommendation (LLM-DMsRec). The\nmethod utilizes a pre-trained GNN model to select the top-k items as candidate\nitem sets and designs prompts along with a large language model (LLM) to infer\nmulti-semantic intents from these candidate items. Specifically, we propose an\nalignment mechanism that effectively integrates the semantic intent inferred by\nthe LLM with the structural intent captured by GNNs. Extensive experiments\nconducted on the Beauty and ML-1M datasets demonstrate that the proposed method\ncan be seamlessly integrated into GNNs framework, significantly enhancing its\nrecommendation performance.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often\nhampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the\nKey-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction\nand learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by\noveremphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading\ninformation from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We\npresent FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel,\ntraining-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information\nretention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency\ndomain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This\napproach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed\nrepresentation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual\ninformation. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical\nspectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on\nLongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by\nup to 22\\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval\naccuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based\napproaches.",

        "abstract": "Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world\nNLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse\nhuman perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and\ncostly, the emerging \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm sheds light on a promising\napproach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,\nto date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona\ndescriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are\nnot generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose\nMAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically\nconstruct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant\ntext documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the\npersonas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate\nmulti-dimensional feedback.

To\nhelp address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks\n(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international\nbenchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and\nclassify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our\nsolutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism\nIdentification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask\n1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address\neach subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck\nModel (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a\nfine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as\nhuman-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained\nexplanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also\ninvestigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,\ncan be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data\naugmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for\nEnglish in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and\nSpanish and 6th for Spanish.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs),\ngenerative recommendation has shown great potential in enhancing both the\naccuracy and semantic understanding of modern recommender systems. Compared to\nLLMs, the Decision Transformer (DT) is a lightweight generative model applied\nto sequential recommendation tasks. However, DT faces challenges in trajectory\nstitching, often producing suboptimal trajectories. Moreover, due to the high\ndimensionality of user states and the vast state space inherent in\nrecommendation scenarios, DT can incur significant computational costs and\nstruggle to learn effective state representations. To overcome these issues, we\npropose a novel Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State\nAbstraction (TADT-CSA) model. Specifically, we combine the conventional\nReturn-To-Go (RTG) signal with a novel temporal advantage (TA) signal that\nencourages the model to capture both long-term returns and their sequential\ntrend. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive state abstraction module into\nthe DT framework to learn more effective and expressive state representations.\nWithin this module, we introduce a TA-conditioned State Vector Quantization\n(TAC-SVQ) strategy, where the TA score guides the state codebooks to\nincorporate contextual token information. Additionally, a reward prediction\nnetwork and a contrastive transition prediction (CTP) network are employed to\nensure the state codebook preserves both the reward information of the current\nstate and the transition information between adjacent states. Empirical results\non both public datasets and an online recommendation system demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the TADT-CSA model and its superiority over baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "Choice models predict which items users choose from presented options. In\nrecommendation settings, they can infer user preferences while countering\nexposure bias. In contrast with traditional univariate recommendation models,\nchoice models consider which competitors appeared with the chosen item. This\nability allows them to distinguish whether a user chose an item due to\npreference, i.e., they liked it; or competition, i.e., it was the best\navailable option. Each choice model assumes specific user behavior, e.g., the\nmultinomial logit model. However, it is currently unclear how accurately these\nassumptions capture actual user behavior, how wrong assumptions impact\ninference, and whether better models exist.\n  In this work, we propose the learned choice model for recommendation\n(LCM4Rec), a non-parametric method for estimating the choice model. By applying\nkernel density estimation, LCM4Rec infers the most likely error distribution\nthat describes the effect of inter-item cannibalization and thereby\ncharacterizes the users' choice model. Thus, it simultaneously infers what\nusers prefer and how they make choices. Our experimental results indicate that\nour method (i) can accurately recover the choice model underlying a dataset;\n(ii) provides robust user preference inference, in contrast with existing\nchoice models that are only effective when their assumptions match user\nbehavior; and (iii) is more resistant against exposure bias than existing\nchoice models. Thereby, we show that learning choice models, instead of\nassuming them, can produce more robust predictions. We believe this work\nprovides an important step towards better understanding users' choice behavior.",

The\nexperimental results show average performance improvements of 38.65\\%, 8.69\\%,\nand 8.19\\% for the ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively, thus\nconfirming the practicality of this method.

Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models\n(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign\nrisk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out\nhuman-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently\nreviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact\nmatch accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and\nradiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning\nimproved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%\nto 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved\n(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no\nstatistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was\nhigh (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference\nwith the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT\n(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels\non par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT\nsupervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for\nlarge-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.",

However, traditional\nRL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to\nlong-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement\nLearning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning\nabilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short\nsegments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail\nsamples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive\nTokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment\nrollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with\n128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\\% to\n85.1\\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\\% to 61.9\\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B\nwith remarkable gains.

        "abstract": "Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for\napplications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains\nsuch as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and\nediting factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the\nprovided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we\nconstruct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial\nquestion-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4,\nPhi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual\ninaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8%\nimprovement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance\ncompared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having\nonly 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2%\ndrop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to\nOpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing\nfactual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a\ngeneralizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of\nlarge language models across diverse applications beyond finance.

        "abstract": "In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform\ntasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring\nany update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear\nwhether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient\nway to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task\nembeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL\nprompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by\nsoftly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using\npre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.\nThis method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt\ndemonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while\nreducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive\nevaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model\nfamilies of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method\noutperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show\nthat our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant\nroles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected\nby our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --\nunderscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection\nmethod opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task\nperformance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the\nactivation space.",

This is due to various motivations\nlike promoting and inclusion, approximating human linguistic behavior, and\nincreasing systems' performance. Diversity has however often been addressed in\nan ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where\nthis notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from\nthe past 6 years, with \"diversity\" or \"diverse\" in their title. We find a wide\nrange of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized\nand using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why,\nwhat on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are\ncast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3\ndimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity. We discuss the trends\nwhich emerge due to this systematized approach. We believe that this study\npaves the way towards a better formalization of diversity in NLP, which should\nbring a better understanding of this notion and a better comparability between\nvarious approaches.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Model-based Time Series Forecasting (LLMTS) has shown\nremarkable promise in handling complex and diverse temporal data, representing\na significant step toward foundation models for time series analysis. However,\nthis emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges. First, the\nsubstantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise\nurgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection. Second, their\npowerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce\nmisleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. To address these concerns,\nwe explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding\nimperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain\ndetectable by specialized algorithms. We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking\nframework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models. Waltz\nis inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are\nrarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold\ntokens''. Leveraging this insight, Waltz embeds watermarks by rewiring the\nsimilarity statistics between patch embeddings and cold token embeddings, and\ndetects watermarks using similarity z-scores. To minimize potential side\neffects, we introduce a similarity-based embedding position identification\nstrategy and employ projected gradient descent to constrain the watermark noise\nwithin a defined boundary. Extensive experiments using two popular LLMTS models\nacross seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Waltz achieves high watermark\ndetection accuracy with minimal impact on the quality of the generated time\nseries.",

Users often require varied and highly customizable\npolicies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.\nConsequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies\nand adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing\nfine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,\nrestricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive\nretraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited\ncontext lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies\ncomprehensively.

        "title": "Speaking in Words, Thinking in Logic: A Dual-Process Framework in QA Systems",
        "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced\nquestion-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts.\nHowever, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law,\nusers demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and\nexplainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks\nhave emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language\nunderstanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches\noften rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating\nnatural language into formal logic representations.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based\nJoint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework\nfor converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing\ninspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by\nefficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as\nSystem 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the\nNL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework\ncomprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and\nSpearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical\ntranslation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.\n  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA\nachieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational\noverhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the\npotential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building\nefficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.",

        "title": "Improving Community Detection in Academic Networks by Handling Publication Bias",
        "abstract": "Finding potential research collaborators is a challenging task, especially in\ntoday's fast-growing and interdisciplinary research landscape. While\ntraditional methods often rely on observable relationships such as\nco-authorships and citations to construct the research network, in this work,\nwe focus solely on publication content to build a topic-based research network\nusing BERTopic with a fine-tuned SciBERT model that connects and recommends\nresearchers across disciplines based on shared topical interests. A major\nchallenge we address is publication imbalance, where some researchers publish\nmuch more than others, often across several topics. Without careful handling,\ntheir less frequent interests are hidden under dominant topics, limiting the\nnetwork's ability to detect their full research scope. To tackle this, we\nintroduce a cloning strategy that clusters a researcher's publications and\ntreats each cluster as a separate node. This allows researchers to be part of\nmultiple communities, improving the detection of interdisciplinary links.\nEvaluation on the proposed method shows that the cloned network structure leads\nto more meaningful communities and uncovers a broader set of collaboration\nopportunities.",
