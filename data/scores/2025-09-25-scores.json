        "title": "Learning Contextual Retrieval for Robust Conversational Search",
        "abstract": "Effective conversational search demands a deep understanding of user intent\nacross multiple dialogue turns. Users frequently use abbreviations and shift\ntopics in the middle of conversations, posing challenges for conventional\nretrievers. While query rewriting techniques improve clarity, they often incur\nsignificant computational cost due to additional autoregressive steps.\nMoreover, although LLM-based retrievers demonstrate strong performance, they\nare not explicitly optimized to track user intent in multi-turn settings, often\nfailing under topic drift or contextual ambiguity. To address these\nlimitations, we propose ContextualRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever that\ndirectly incorporates conversational context into the retrieval process. Our\napproach introduces: (1) a context-aware embedding mechanism that highlights\nthe current query within the dialogue history; (2) intent-guided supervision\nbased on high-quality rewritten queries; and (3) a training strategy that\npreserves the generative capabilities of the base LLM. Extensive evaluations\nacross multiple conversational search benchmarks demonstrate that\nContextualRetriever significantly outperforms existing methods while incurring\nno additional inference overhead.",

        "abstract": "Linking implicit scientific claims made on social media to their original\npublications is crucial for evidence-based fact-checking and scholarly\ndiscourse, yet it is hindered by lexical sparsity, very short queries, and\ndomain-specific language. Team AIRwaves ranked second in Subtask 4b of the\nCLEF-2025 CheckThat! Lab with an evidence-retrieval approach that markedly\noutperforms the competition baseline. The optimized sparse-retrieval\nbaseline(BM25) achieves MRR@5 = 0.5025 on the gold label blind test set. To\nsurpass this baseline, a two-stage retrieval pipeline is introduced: (i) a\nfirst stage that uses a dual encoder based on E5-large, fine-tuned using\nin-batch and mined hard negatives and enhanced through chunked tokenization and\nrich document metadata; and (ii) a neural re-ranking stage using a SciBERT\ncross-encoder. Replacing purely lexical matching with neural representations\nlifts performance to MRR@5 = 0.6174, and the complete pipeline further improves\nto MRR@5 = 0.6828.

        "abstract": "Vector search powers transformers technology, but real-world use demands\nhybrid queries that combine vector similarity with attribute filters (e.g.,\n\"top document in category X, from 2023\"). Current solutions trade off recall,\nspeed, and flexibility, relying on fragile index hacks that don't scale. We\nintroduce FusedANN (Fused Attribute-Vector Nearest Neighbor), a geometric\nframework that elevates filtering to ANN optimization constraints and\nintroduces a convex fused space via a Lagrangian-like relaxation. Our method\njointly embeds attributes and vectors through transformer-based\nconvexification, turning hard filters into continuous, weighted penalties that\npreserve top-k semantics while enabling efficient approximate search. We prove\nthat FusedANN reduces to exact filtering under high selectivity, gracefully\nrelaxes to semantically nearest attributes when exact matches are insufficient,\nand preserves downstream ANN alpha-approximation guarantees. Empirically,\nFusedANN improves query throughput by eliminating brittle filtering stages,\nachieving superior recall-latency tradeoffs on standard hybrid benchmarks\nwithout specialized index hacks, delivering up to 3 times higher throughput and\nbetter recall than state-of-the-art hybrid and graph-based systems.\nTheoretically, we provide explicit error bounds and parameter selection rules\nthat make FusedANN practical for production. This establishes a principled,\nscalable, and verifiable bridge between symbolic constraints and vector\nsimilarity, unlocking a new generation of filtered retrieval systems for large,\nhybrid, and dynamic NLP/ML workloads.",

        "abstract": "Data voids--areas of the internet where reliable information is scarce or\nabsent--pose significant challenges to online health information seeking,\nparticularly for users operating in low-web data languages. These voids are\nincreasingly encountered not on traditional search engines alone, but on social\nmedia platforms, which have gradually morphed into informal search engines for\nmillions of people. In this paper, we introduce the phenomenon of data\nhorizons: a critical boundary where algorithmic structures begin to degrade the\nrelevance and reliability of search results. Unlike the core of a data void,\nwhich is often exploited by bad actors to spread misinformation, the data\nhorizon marks the critical space where systemic factors, such as linguistic\nunderrepresentation, algorithmic amplification, and socio-cultural mismatch,\ncreate conditions of informational instability. Focusing on Tigrinya and\nAmharic as languages of study, we evaluate (1) the common characteristics of\nsearch results for health queries, (2) the quality and credibility of health\ninformation, and (3) characteristics of search results that diverge from their\nqueries. We find that search results for health queries in low-web data\nlanguages may not always be in the language of search and may be dominated by\nnutritional and religious advice. We show that search results that diverge from\ntheir queries in low-resourced languages are due to algorithmic failures,\n(un)intentional manipulation, or active manipulation by content creators. We\nuse our findings to illustrate how a data horizon manifests under several\ninteracting constraints on information availability.",

A\nGuesser LLM identifies a hidden object by posing free-form questions to an\nOracle without predefined choices or candidate lists. To measure question\nquality, we propose two information gain (IG) metrics: a Bayesian method that\ntracks belief updates over semantic concepts using LLM-scored relevance, and an\nentropy-based method that filters candidates via ConceptNet. Both metrics are\nmodel-agnostic and support post hoc analysis. Across 858 games with multiple\nmodels and prompting strategies, higher IG strongly predicts efficiency: a\none-standard-deviation IG increase reduces expected game length by 43\\%.\nPrompting constraints guided by IG, such as enforcing question diversity,\nenable weaker models to significantly improve performance.

To provide a comprehensive and reproducible synthesis\nof this emerging field, we employed the APISSER methodology, a task-oriented\nframework adapted from the PRISMA protocol.

Our findings highlight that many classical DSP algorithms,\nsuch as Kalman filtering, carrier recovery, adaptive equalization, and\nmachine-learning-assisted signal estimation, have been successfully adapted to\nthe quantum regime, often requiring modifications to meet security and noise\nconstraints. We also identify a range of recent DSP innovations in coherent\noptical communication systems with high potential for future CV-QKD\nintegration, including neural equalization, probabilistic shaping, and joint\nretiming-equalization filters. Despite these advances, challenges remain in\nachieving robust phase tracking under ultra-low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)\nconditions, real-time polarization compensation, and secure co-existence with\nclassical channels.

Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP)\nand large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the automatic classification\nof textual data according to their relevance to specific SDGs. Nevertheless, in\nmany applications, it is equally important to determine the directionality of\nthis relevance; that is, to assess whether the described impact is positive,\nneutral, or negative. To tackle this challenge, we propose the novel task of\nSDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates\nprogress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such\nprogress. To support research in this area, we introduce SDG-POD, a benchmark\ndataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and\nsynthetically generated data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using six\nstate-of-the-art large LLMs, considering both zero-shot and fine-tuned\nconfigurations. Our results suggest that the task remains challenging for the\ncurrent generation of LLMs. Nevertheless, some fine-tuned models, particularly\nQWQ-32B, achieve good performance, especially on specific Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals such as SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure),\nSDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG-15 (Life on Land).\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the fine-tuning dataset with\nsynthetically generated examples yields improved model performance on this\ntask.

This thesis investigates the\nimpact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set\nto explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code\nmetrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and\nhigh-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five\ndatasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both\nuser and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented\nwith algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically\nsignificant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline\n(0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not\nlead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user\nfeatures (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did\nimprove its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by\nleading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user\nalgorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user\nfeatures is overwhelmingly dominant.

However, these methods remain constrained by the\nlimitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode\nphysical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex\nrule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely\nlimited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires\ncomputationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a\nreflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We\nfirst discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action\ncodebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for\nplanning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware\nreflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient\ncomputation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to\nmodel multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search\nmethods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then\nserve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration.

During inference, TtT\nemploys block-wise diffusion to synthesize audio in parallel while flexibly\nhandling variable-length outputs.

We evaluate several\nmainstream LLMs and find that, despite high headline accuracy, substantial\nbiases persist in many downstream tasks as a direct consequence of prompt\ncoverage.

We compare state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs with encoder-based\nmodels across three tasks: dialect classification, topic classification, and\nextractive question answering, controlling for varying scripts (Latin vs.\nnon-Latin) and resource availability (high vs. low). Our analysis reveals that\nTP is a better predictor of the performance on tasks reliant on syntactic and\nmorphological cues (e.g., extractive QA), while IP better predicts performance\nin semantic tasks (e.g., topic classification).

        "title": "Benchmarking Gaslighting Attacks Against Speech Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "As Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) become increasingly integrated\ninto voice-based applications, ensuring their robustness against manipulative\nor adversarial input becomes critical. Although prior work has studied\nadversarial attacks in text-based LLMs and vision-language models, the unique\ncognitive and perceptual challenges of speech-based interaction remain\nunderexplored. In contrast, speech presents inherent ambiguity, continuity, and\nperceptual diversity, which make adversarial attacks more difficult to detect.\nIn this paper, we introduce gaslighting attacks, strategically crafted prompts\ndesigned to mislead, override, or distort model reasoning as a means to\nevaluate the vulnerability of Speech LLMs. Specifically, we construct five\nmanipulation strategies: Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and\nProfessional Negation, designed to test model robustness across varied tasks.\nIt is worth noting that our framework captures both performance degradation and\nbehavioral responses, including unsolicited apologies and refusals, to diagnose\ndifferent dimensions of susceptibility. Moreover, acoustic perturbation\nexperiments are conducted to assess multi-modal robustness. To quantify model\nvulnerability, comprehensive evaluation across 5 Speech and multi-modal LLMs on\nover 10,000 test samples from 5 diverse datasets reveals an average accuracy\ndrop of 24.3% under the five gaslighting attacks, indicating significant\nbehavioral vulnerability. These findings highlight the need for more resilient\nand trustworthy speech-based AI systems.",

        "abstract": "Pedestrian safety is a critical component of urban mobility and is strongly\ninfluenced by the interactions between pedestrian decision-making and driver\nyielding behavior at crosswalks. Modeling driver--pedestrian interactions at\nintersections requires accurately capturing the complexity of these behaviors.\nTraditional machine learning models often struggle to capture the nuanced and\ncontext-dependent reasoning required for these multifactorial interactions, due\nto their reliance on fixed feature representations and limited\ninterpretability. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) are suited for\nextracting patterns from heterogeneous traffic data, enabling accurate modeling\nof driver-pedestrian interactions. Therefore, this paper leverages multimodal\nLLMs through a novel prompt design that incorporates domain-specific knowledge,\nstructured reasoning, and few-shot prompting, enabling interpretable and\ncontext-aware inference of driver yielding behavior, as an example application\nof modeling pedestrian--driver interaction. We benchmarked state-of-the-art\nLLMs against traditional classifiers, finding that GPT-4o consistently achieves\nthe highest accuracy and recall, while Deepseek-V3 excels in precision. These\nfindings highlight the critical trade-offs between model performance and\ncomputational efficiency, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in\nreal-world pedestrian safety systems.",

        "abstract": "The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap\nbetween their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic,\ninformation-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the\ncomputational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain\npoorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational\ncognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context\nSaturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key\nmechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive\nEvaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these\nload factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N\n= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant\nperformance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller\nopen-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)\nexhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all\nconditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In\ncontrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%\naccuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation\nunder context saturation ($\\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These\nfindings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor\nto reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under\nuncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as\nexemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true\nresilience and safety of advanced AI systems.",

        "abstract": "Evaluating disfluency removal in speech requires more than aggregate\ntoken-level scores. Traditional word-based metrics such as precision, recall,\nand F1 (E-Scores) capture overall performance but cannot reveal why models\nsucceed or fail. We introduce Z-Scores, a span-level linguistically-grounded\nevaluation metric that categorizes system behavior across distinct disfluency\ntypes (EDITED, INTJ, PRN). Our deterministic alignment module enables robust\nmapping between generated text and disfluent transcripts, allowing Z-Scores to\nexpose systematic weaknesses that word-level metrics obscure. By providing\ncategory-specific diagnostics, Z-Scores enable researchers to identify model\nfailure modes and design targeted interventions -- such as tailored prompts or\ndata augmentation -- yielding measurable performance improvements. A case study\nwith LLMs shows that Z-Scores uncover challenges with INTJ and PRN disfluencies\nhidden in aggregate F1, directly informing model refinement strategies.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal data has significantly advanced recommendation systems by\nintegrating diverse information sources to model user preferences and item\ncharacteristics. However, these systems often struggle with redundant and\nirrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods\neither fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural\nseparation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model\nthe complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled\nInformation Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal\nInformation Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively\nfiltering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information.\nThen, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the\nrecommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We\nachieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information\nlearning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information\nlearning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning\nobjective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives,\nMRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations.\nExtensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in\nenhancing multimodal recommendation.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data\nefficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text\ndata with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been\ngrowing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data\nremains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data\nconstitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that\ncertain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model\ncapacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally\ncomplex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented\nPre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with\nautomatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively\nincreases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more\nlearnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across\ndiverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training\nwith both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong\nopen-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method\nsubstantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and\nfamilies. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a\nfactor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training\nperformance by over $10\\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.",

Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models\n(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs\nempower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing\nhigh-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions\ninto embodied cognition.

As such, this paper\ncomprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,\ncovering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present\nthe history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied\nAI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal\nangle.

I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to\nthis failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental\nin the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a\nconversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I\nwill claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the\nestablishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a\nfundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of\nhallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the\ndisconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical\nconversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with\nseveral additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour. I will\ndiscuss how these techniques do nothing to solve the disconnect and can make it\nworse.",

For the Pilot Task, we\ndesigned a set of conversational strategies to interact with LLM-powered\npersonas, focusing on maximizing information gain within a limited number of\ndialogue turns. In Task 2, our system ranked 8th out of 12 participating teams\nbased on F1 score. However, a deeper analysis revealed that our models were\namong the fastest in issuing early predictions, which is a critical factor in\nreal-world deployment scenarios. This highlights the trade-off between early\ndetection and classification accuracy, suggesting potential avenues for\noptimizing both jointly in future work. In the Pilot Task, we achieved 1st\nplace out of 5 teams, obtaining the best overall performance across all\nevaluation metrics: DCHR, ADODL and ASHR. Our success in this task demonstrates\nthe effectiveness of structured conversational design when combined with\npowerful language models, reinforcing the feasibility of deploying LLMs in\nsensitive mental health assessment contexts.",

        "abstract": "Accurate text recognition for historical documents can greatly advance the\nstudy and preservation of cultural heritage. Existing vision-language models\n(VLMs), however, are designed for modern, standardized texts and are not\nequipped to read the diverse languages and scripts, irregular layouts, and\nfrequent degradation found in historical materials.\n  This paper presents CHURRO, a 3B-parameter open-weight VLM specialized for\nhistorical text recognition. The model is trained on CHURRO-DS, the largest\nhistorical text recognition dataset to date. CHURRO-DS unifies 155 historical\ncorpora comprising 99,491 pages, spanning 22 centuries of textual heritage\nacross 46 language clusters, including historical variants and dead languages.\n  We evaluate several open-weight and closed VLMs and optical character\nrecognition (OCR) systems on CHURRO-DS and find that CHURRO outperforms all\nother VLMs. On the CHURRO-DS test set, CHURRO achieves 82.3% (printed) and\n70.1% (handwritten) normalized Levenshtein similarity, surpassing the\nsecond-best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, by 1.4% and 6.5%, respectively, while being\n15.5 times more cost-effective.\n  By releasing the model and dataset, we aim to enable community-driven\nresearch to improve the readability of historical texts and accelerate\nscholarship.",

        "title": "UserRL: Training Interactive User-Centric Agent via Reinforcement Learning",
        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that\nmove beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions.\nYet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a\nsetting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In\nthis work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating\nuser-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with\nsimulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and\ntrajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect\nlearning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal\nthree key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial\ninteraction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate\ntrajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;\nand (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,\nopen-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and\ntransferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of\nreward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and\nestablish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric\nagentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.",
