        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for\ntasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.\nHowever, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive\ncomputational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.\nIn this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle\nthis challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a\nframework that renders long texts into images and processes them with\nvision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual\ninput while preserving semantic information, and we further design an\nLLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations\nfor balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining\naccuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context\nbenchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and\ndecoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme\ncompression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text\ntasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal\ntasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at\nhttps://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.",

        "abstract": "Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in\nlanguage models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly\nunderstood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.\npresident or an API call) does not \"average out\" by recalling another. Hence,\nwe propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when\nbackward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before\npost-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to\nquantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects\nand obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add\nchance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random\nguessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across\npost-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis\nshows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with\nlow-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base\nmodels and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on\nmath and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to\ninstruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both\nforgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed\nand warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not\nreliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical\nyardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --\nenabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities\nbut struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge\nretention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods\nsuffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while\nexisting parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task\nscenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a\nnovel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of\nself-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while\npreserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient\nadaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our\nHybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a\nshared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM\nmodules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion.\nExtensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering,\ncode generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance\nimprovement of 3.65%.

        "abstract": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by\ndetecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot\nperformance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often\ncompromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical\ndownstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish\nbetween fine-grained classes such as \"fishing boat\" and \"yacht\" since their\nembeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user\ngoals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.\nTo address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad\ngeneralization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot\nclassifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate\nhigh-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high\nprecision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of\nuser-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery\nannotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning\nstrategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME\nidentifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision\nboundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample\ndiversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without\ncostly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then\na minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our\nmethod consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,\nestablishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting\nfoundation models to specific user needs.",

DELULU significantly outperforms prior self-supervised learning\n(SSL) models across a range of speaker-centric tasks, achieving up to 62%\nrelative improvement in equal error rate (EER) for speaker verification and\nconsistent gains on zero-shot profiling tasks such as gender, age, accent, and\nspeaker counting.

Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort\nlegal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to\nsystematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for\ntort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large\nlanguage models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our\nresults indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling\ncrucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several\nbaseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning\nthrough prompting or post-training.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often experience language confusion, which is\nthe unintended mixing of languages during text generation. Current solutions to\nthis problem either necessitate model retraining or cannot differentiate\nbetween harmful confusion and acceptable code-switching. This paper introduces\nthe Language Confusion Gate (LCG), a lightweight, plug-in solution that filters\ntokens during decoding without altering the base LLM. The LCG is trained using\nnorm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and\napply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that\nlanguage confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the\ntop predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource\nlanguages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models,\nincluding Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion\nsignificantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting\ntask performance.

In particular,\nrole-play prompts, where the model is assigned a functional role or identity,\noften give more robust and accurate relevance rankings. However, the mechanisms\nand diversity of role-play effects remain underexplored, limiting both\neffective use and interpretability. In this work, we systematically examine how\nrole-play variations influence zero-shot LLM rankers. We employ causal\nintervention techniques from mechanistic interpretability to trace how\nrole-play information shapes relevance judgments in LLMs. Our analysis reveals\nthat (1) careful formulation of role descriptions have a large effect on the\nranking quality of the LLM; (2) role-play signals are predominantly encoded in\nearly layers and communicate with task instructions in middle layers, while\nreceiving limited interaction with query or document representations.\nSpecifically, we identify a group of attention heads that encode information\ncritical for role-conditioned relevance. These findings not only shed light on\nthe inner workings of role-play in LLM ranking but also offer guidance for\ndesigning more effective prompts in IR and beyond, pointing toward broader\nopportunities for leveraging role-play in zero-shot applications.",

While recent verification-refinement\nframeworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems,\ntheir effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction\ncapabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This\nwork demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities\non hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially\nextended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning\n(DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step\nrepresents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is\nthat convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability\nof improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple\nlong-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small\npositive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct\nanswers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On\nthe challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously\nunsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model\nto surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through\nmajority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER\nframework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight\nreasoners.

        "abstract": "Idiomatic translation remains a significant challenge in machine translation,\nespecially for low resource languages such as Urdu, and has received limited\nprior attention. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first\nevaluation datasets for Urdu to English idiomatic translation, covering both\nNative Urdu and Roman Urdu scripts and annotated with gold-standard English\nequivalents. We evaluate multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nNeural Machine Translation (NMT) systems on this task, focusing on their\nability to preserve idiomatic and cultural meaning. Automatic metrics including\nBLEU, BERTScore, COMET, and XCOMET are used to assess translation quality. Our\nfindings indicate that prompt engineering enhances idiomatic translation\ncompared to direct translation, though performance differences among prompt\ntypes are relatively minor. Moreover, cross script comparisons reveal that text\nrepresentation substantially affects translation quality, with Native Urdu\ninputs producing more accurate idiomatic translations than Roman Urdu.",

However, applying large language\nmodels (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic\nreasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain\nLLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal\nintegration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these\nlimitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM,\nintegrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback\nrefinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning\nrather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and\nethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive\nknowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based\ninstruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation\nmechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process\ninvolving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for\ntongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic\naccess to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question\nbenchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior\naccuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics,\nherb recognition, and constitution classification.

These errors underscore the\nurgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of\nlanguage models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this\ngap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic\ninterpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust\nin such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions.\nFirst, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic\ninterpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the\nliterature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and\nreasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and\nautonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations\nfor explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in\nthe evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities,\ncritical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned,\ntrustworthy LLM explanations.",

        "abstract": "News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by\nhow they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in\nanother, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally\ncharged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in\nturn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger\nreactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion\nanalysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we\nanalyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the\ndominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear\ndominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,\nand significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed\nacross outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a\nhuman-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers\nrecognize hidden affective framing in daily news.",

While these methods improve visual\nquality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To\nsystematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline,\nwe introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating\nsocial representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias\ntaxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to\ndisentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes\n(gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to\nevaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity,\n(3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4)\nthe temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we\nconduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference\ndatasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through\nalignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment\ntuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them\ntemporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals.

To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec,\na two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the\ndenoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by\naligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the\nefficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains\nthe denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing\nthe consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we\ncan smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step\nwith bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces\nAdaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user\npreference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps.\nExtensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively\nmitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both\nefficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.",

However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm\ninitiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces\nunnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic\nscenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first\ndesign a \\textit{\\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where\nreasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once\nreading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with\n\\textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading\nthrough the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint\ntraining, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker\nemploys streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation,\nenforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and\nposition encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input\nencoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling\ntrue concurrency.

However, existing unlearning\napproaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model\nutility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated\nresponses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive\napplications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)\nframework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)\ncontext-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens\nwithout disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant\nresponse shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about\nunlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level\ninterventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning\nset to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention\nenhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in\nthe retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components\nare jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary\nthat localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under\nrepresentation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves\nperformance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods,\nachieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC\nbenchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning\neffectiveness.

Most modern diffusion-based\nlanguage models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively\nprocessing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask\nor replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards\nvaluable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically\nblends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$\npredicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This\nprovides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from\nearlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to\npropagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a\npretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate\nthat continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved\nperplexity and MAUVE scores.

This study investigates whether people adopt the\nintentional stance, attributing mental states to explain behavior,toward AI\nduring irony comprehension. Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it\nrequires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors\nthrough effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural\nresponses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established\nERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing\ncognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results\ndemonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward\nAI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to\ndeliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI\nthan human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as\ncomputational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for\nAI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis\nconsistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people\nwho perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for\nAI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated\nby specific mental models of artificial agents.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but\nthis generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are\nrequired, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these\nscenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much\nof what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a\nfundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information\nthrough conversation?\n  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating\nlatent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden\nuser attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three\nprogressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized\nQuestion Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a\ntri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of\nelicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed\nsurface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically\nwith context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number\nof hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework\nfor studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,\nhighlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for\nbuilding truly adaptive AI systems.",

However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social\nbias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and\nuncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype\nrepetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary\njustification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or\nintroduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these\ninsights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that\nqueries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific\nfailure patterns.

We model prompt sensitivity as a type of generalization error, and show\nthat sampling across the semantic ``concept space'' with paraphrasing\nperturbations improves uncertainty calibration without compromising accuracy.\nAdditionally, we introduce a new metric for uncertainty decomposition in\nblack-box LLMs that improves upon entropy-based decomposition by modeling\nsemantic continuities in natural language generation. We show that this\ndecomposition metric can be used to quantify how much LLM uncertainty is\nattributed to prompt sensitivity.

Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we\nask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful\nunder normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden\ntrigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that\nembed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate\nbackdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but\nrecover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing\nsuch attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed\nand how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between\nbackdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens\nconsistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals\nthat these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing\ntriggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly\nenhances backdoor persistence.

Examples of target properties $T$ include the\nbinary flag that triggers an LLM's harmful response or rejection, and the\ndegree to which information deleted by unlearning can be restored, both\nelicited via adversarial instructions. The LLM reveals an \\emph{observable\nsignal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response\ncontaining answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of\ninformation leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled\nguidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this\ngap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information\ncan be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods\ncome to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between\nthe observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query,\nwe show that achieving error $\\varepsilon$ requires at least\n$\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak\nrate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest\nincrease in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic\nin terms of the desired accuracy. Experiments on seven LLMs across\nsystem-prompt leakage, jailbreak, and relearning attacks corroborate the\ntheory: exposing answer tokens alone requires about a thousand queries; adding\nlogits cuts this to about a hundred; and revealing the full thinking process\ntrims it to a few dozen.

While datasets such\nas BD-SHS provide a basis for structured evaluation, most prior approaches rely\non either computationally costly full-model fine-tuning or proprietary APIs.\nThis paper presents the first application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three\ninstruction-tuned large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and\nMistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated\ncomments. Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters,\nenabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU. The results show that\nLlama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at\n88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. These findings establish PEFT as a practical\nand replicable strategy for Bengali and related low-resource languages.",

Current\nevaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like\nsolution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In\nthis study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework\nfor LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our\nframework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision\nvariables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error\n(RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate\nGPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of\nvarying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5\nconsistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency,\nand modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver\nperformance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint\nRMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability.\nConstraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while\nconcise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight\nthree principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint\ncoverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures\nsolver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational\nefficiency.

To address this question, we\narchitecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via\nreinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Process (POMDP).

In practice, SFT on a full dataset\nis computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias\namplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which\nprioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online\nbatch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the\ntraining process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on\nthe utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors\nlike diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or\nvalidation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset\ntraining. To address these limitations, this work develops \\textbf{UDS\n(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection\nin SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both\ndata utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample\ndiversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a\nlightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the\nneed for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing\ncomputational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that\nUDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods\nunder varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to\nfull-dataset fine-tuning.

        "abstract": "Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research\nreports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with\nthe emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based\ndata agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain\nfundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their\nreliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,\nthe first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of\nautomatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to\nanalyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science\ntasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates\nthe learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to\nprogressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world\nenvironments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework\nthat constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,\nDeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data\nquestion answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data\nresearch. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze\noutperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary\nLLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,\npaving the way toward autonomous data science.",

        "abstract": "The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented\nperformance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability.\nThis paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems\nthat learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose\nNeuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a\nneural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than\na monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as\nan independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient\ninteractions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation\nunfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This\nlow-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons\nexchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and\ninter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant\nparameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal\nstability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the\ncontraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence\nprocessing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities\ncorrespond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the\nneural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability.\nEmpirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate\nimproved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate\ncompression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and\ncross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude\nby discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured\nneuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional\nlearning systems.",

The approach combines\nfive elements. First, commitments that bind data sources, preprocessing,\nlicenses, and per epoch quota counters to a manifest.

        "abstract": "Language model users often embed personal and social context in their\nquestions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed --\ncreates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations,\nwhile capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking.\nThis gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use\ndisorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide\naccessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for\nUser-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based\nquestions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery\ncommunity (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles --\npatients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321\nquestions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our\nevaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable\nto real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but\ndiffering roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as\npatients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced\nknowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates\nhow implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a\nmethodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based\nreasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus\nsuperficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question\nthrough entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along\nnumerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the\nNile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite\nhaving sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make\npredictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases\nthat strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order,\nand semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression\nusing only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the\nmodel's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override\nprincipled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters)\nselectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller\nmodels (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why\nlarger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more\naccurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using\nthe numerical features across all model sizes.",

Existing methods mainly\nrely on large-scale human-annotated data, which is costly to obtain and\ntime-consuming. This is because whole-page annotation is far more complex than\nsingle-modal: it requires assessing the entire result page while accounting for\ncross-modal relevance differences. Thus, how to improve whole-page reranking\nperformance while reducing annotation costs is still a key challenge in\noptimizing search engine result pages(SERP). In this paper, we propose SMAR, a\nnovel whole-page reranking framework that leverages strong Single-modal rankers\nto guide Modal-wise relevance Alignment for effective Reranking, using only\nlimited whole-page annotation to outperform fully-annotated reranking models.\nSpecifically, high-quality single-modal rankers are first trained on data\nspecific to their respective modalities. Then, for each query, we select a\nsubset of their outputs to construct candidate pages and perform human\nannotation at the page level. Finally, we train the whole-page reranker using\nthese limited annotations and enforcing consistency with single-modal\npreferences to maintain ranking quality within each modality.

Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal\nSegmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the\ncontinuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.\nThese segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to\nidentify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By\nselecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging\nthe VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework\nautomatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.\nThis approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway\nfor zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.",

        "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but\nremain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and\nlacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To\naddress these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that\nenhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For\nscalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a\nlightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual\ndescriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant\ncontext while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination,\nGraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable\nmodality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual\nmodality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit\ntopology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large\ngraphs, up to $200\\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and\nconsistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods,\nachieving up to $4.4\\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art\nbaselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.",

To mitigate this limitation, a promising\napproach is to allow agents to learn from game interactions automatically,\nwithout relying on costly expert-labeled data.

For example, \"summer is approaching\" parallels \"We\nare approaching the summer\". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of\nreference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint.\nExtending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines\nhow temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of\n\"now\". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in\nnatural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about\ntime remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding\nunder Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event\nand event-event relations when the reference point of \"now\" dynamically shifts\nalong a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition\n\\cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the\ncurrent moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00\n(highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment\nbetween the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit\nmeasurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking\naround the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The\nadaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while\nLLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning\nremains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.",

We also use same-language country\npairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal\npaths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for\ncross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific\npatterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and\nhigh variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned\ninternal representation.",

        "abstract": "Peer review serves as the gatekeeper of science, yet the surge in submissions\nand widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scholarly evaluation\npresent unprecedented challenges. Recent work has focused on using LLMs to\nimprove review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However,\nunchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to\nsystematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic\nintegrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an\nautomated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard\nemploys a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR\nand NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2)\nannotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class\nimbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation,\nproducing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438\nsynthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source\nLLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of\nthe review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate\nlower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural\ncomplexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text\ndetection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have\nincreased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models,\nmixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial\nenhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents\nthe first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing\nevidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable\ninsights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.",

        "abstract": "Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and\nintegration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain\nenvironments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval\napproaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and\ncomposition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete\ncapability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component\nselection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and\nreal-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,\nautomated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the\nknapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically\nidentify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly\nconsidering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically\ntesting candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our\napproach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable\nreuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five\nbenchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer\nconsistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at\nsignificantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the\nsingle-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate\nimprovement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In\nmulti-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from\n37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The\nsubstantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method\nacross diverse domains and budget constraints.",

While\nuncertainty quantification is well-studied for single-turn tasks, multi-turn\nagentic scenarios with real-world tool access present unique challenges where\nuncertainties and ambiguities compound, leading to severe or catastrophic risks\nbeyond traditional text generation failures. We propose using \"quitting\" as a\nsimple yet effective behavioral mechanism for LLM agents to recognize and\nwithdraw from situations where they lack confidence.

        "abstract": "Natural Language Inference datasets often exhibit human label variation. To\nbetter understand these variations, explanation-based approaches analyze the\nunderlying reasoning behind annotators' decisions. One such approach is the\nLiTEx taxonomy, which categorizes free-text explanations in English into\nreasoning types. However, previous work applying such taxonomies has focused on\nwithin-label variation: cases where annotators agree on the final NLI label but\nprovide different explanations. In contrast, this paper broadens the scope by\nexamining how annotators may diverge not only in the reasoning type but also in\nthe labeling step. We use explanations as a lens to decompose the reasoning\nprocess underlying NLI annotation and to analyze individual differences. We\napply LiTEx to two NLI English datasets and align annotation variation from\nmultiple aspects: NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy\nagreement, with an additional compounding factor of annotators' selection bias.\nWe observe instances where annotators disagree on the label but provide highly\nsimilar explanations, suggesting that surface-level disagreement may mask\nunderlying agreement in interpretation. Moreover, our analysis reveals\nindividual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices. These\nfindings highlight that agreement in reasoning types better reflects the\nsemantic similarity of free-text explanations than label agreement alone.

Among these, external TTS\n(particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance\nimprovements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning\ntrajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high\ncomputational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the\nunderutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce\nTrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the\nhidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to\nexpansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon\nfootprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the\nredundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of\ntokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this\ninefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework\nfor LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens.\nLeveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX,\nwe assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to\npreserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse\nfrugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment\nAnalysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a\nsuite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction\nincurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that\ncontemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In\ncontrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply,\nreflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis\nwith bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns\nthat may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may\nresort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional\nNLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding\nof LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the\nboundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring\nexhaustive context.

To address these challenges, we introduce a generic\nneuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The\ncore of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline\nknowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an\nLLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic\nknowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and\nrefined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain\nrequirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is\nencoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes\nthis encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a\nreliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task,\nwe demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with\nstate-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while\nmaintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected\nknowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models,\nwhile exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input\nperturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks.

To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral\nscenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider\nessential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench\ncontains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations,\nweighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI\nadvising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously.\nSeparately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can\nreason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that\nscaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning\ntasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also\nshow partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act\nUtilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular\ntraining paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused\nreasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI.",

Regarding the inherent relation-dependency\nand reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into\ntwo categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question,\ni.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent\nsub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding\nsequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as\nessential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning\napproaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact\nverification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former\nexcels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning\ntasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning\nbut suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel\nfact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and\naccuracy for multi-hop QA tasks.

        "abstract": "Despite recent advances in AI, multimodal culturally diverse datasets are\nstill limited, particularly for regions in the Middle East and Africa. In this\npaper, we introduce EgMM-Corpus, a multimodal dataset dedicated to Egyptian\nculture. By designing and running a new data collection pipeline, we collected\nover 3,000 images, covering 313 concepts across landmarks, food, and folklore.\nEach entry in the dataset is manually validated for cultural authenticity and\nmultimodal coherence. EgMM-Corpus aims to provide a reliable resource for\nevaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context.\nWe further evaluate the zero-shot performance of Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-training CLIP on EgMM-Corpus, on which it achieves 21.2% Top-1 accuracy and\n36.4% Top-5 accuracy in classification. These results underscore the existing\ncultural bias in large-scale vision-language models and demonstrate the\nimportance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware\nmodels.",

        "title": "In Generative AI We (Dis)Trust? Computational Analysis of Trust and Distrust in Reddit Discussions",
        "abstract": "The rise of generative AI (GenAI) has impacted many aspects of human life. As\nthese systems become embedded in everyday practices, understanding public trust\nin them also becomes essential for responsible adoption and governance. Prior\nwork on trust in AI has largely drawn from psychology and human-computer\ninteraction, but there is a lack of computational, large-scale, and\nlongitudinal approaches to measuring trust and distrust in GenAI and large\nlanguage models (LLMs). This paper presents the first computational study of\nTrust and Distrust in GenAI, using a multi-year Reddit dataset (2022--2025)\nspanning 39 subreddits and 197,618 posts. Crowd-sourced annotations of a\nrepresentative sample were combined with classification models to scale\nanalysis. We find that Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with\nshifts around major model releases. Technical performance and usability\ndominate as dimensions, while personal experience is the most frequent reason\nshaping attitudes. Distinct patterns also emerge across trustors (e.g.,\nexperts, ethicists, general users). Our results provide a methodological\nframework for large-scale Trust analysis and insights into evolving public\nperceptions of GenAI.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human\nannotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference\nfine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain\nset of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human\nFeedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework,\nparticularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the\ninternal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In\nthis work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model\nalignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its\ntuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology\non \\textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized:\nmid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines\nreward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely\nunaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number\nof layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward\ngains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from\nhuman-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather\nthan diffuse and parameteric.",

        "abstract": "Classic zeroth-order optimization approaches typically optimize for a\nsmoothed version of the original function, i.e., the expected objective under\nrandomly perturbed model parameters. This can be interpreted as encouraging the\nloss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular\nsharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the\nlargest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively.\nIn this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding\nobjectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting\nobjective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the\nmax-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft\nSAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise\ncharacterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework.\nPractically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient\nalternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to\nvanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including\nclassification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.",

        "abstract": "Scientific literature is increasingly siloed by complex language, static\ndisciplinary structures, and potentially sparse keyword systems, making it\ncumbersome to capture the dynamic nature of modern science. This study\naddresses these challenges by introducing an adaptable large language model\n(LLM)-driven framework to quantify thematic trends and map the evolving\nlandscape of scientific knowledge. The approach is demonstrated over a 20-year\ncollection of more than 1,500 engineering articles published by the Proceedings\nof the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), marked for their breadth and depth\nof research focus. A two-stage classification pipeline first establishes a\nprimary thematic category for each article based on its abstract. The\nsubsequent phase performs a full-text analysis to assign secondary\nclassifications, revealing latent, cross-topic connections across the corpus.\nTraditional natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as Bag-of-Words\n(BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), confirm the\nresulting topical structure and also suggest that standalone word-frequency\nanalyses may be insufficient for mapping fields with high diversity. Finally, a\ndisjoint graph representation between the primary and secondary classifications\nreveals implicit connections between themes that may be less apparent when\nanalyzing abstracts or keywords alone. The findings show that the approach\nindependently recovers much of the journal's editorially embedded structure\nwithout prior knowledge of its existing dual-classification schema (e.g.,\nbiological studies also classified as engineering). This framework offers a\npowerful tool for detecting potential thematic trends and providing a\nhigh-level overview of scientific progress.",

        "abstract": "Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) pose a critical privacy threat by\nenabling adversaries to determine whether a specific sample was included in a\nmodel's training dataset. Despite extensive research on MIAs, systematic\ncomparisons between generative and discriminative classifiers remain limited.\nThis work addresses this gap by first providing theoretical motivation for why\ngenerative classifiers exhibit heightened susceptibility to MIAs, then\nvalidating these insights through comprehensive empirical evaluation. Our study\nencompasses discriminative, generative, and pseudo-generative text classifiers\nacross varying training data volumes, evaluated on nine benchmark datasets.\nEmploying a diverse array of MIA strategies, we consistently demonstrate that\nfully generative classifiers which explicitly model the joint likelihood\n$P(X,Y)$ are most vulnerable to membership leakage. Furthermore, we observe\nthat the canonical inference approach commonly used in generative classifiers\nsignificantly amplifies this privacy risk. These findings reveal a fundamental\nutility-privacy trade-off inherent in classifier design, underscoring the\ncritical need for caution when deploying generative classifiers in\nprivacy-sensitive applications. Our results motivate future research directions\nin developing privacy-preserving generative classifiers that can maintain\nutility while mitigating membership inference vulnerabilities.",
