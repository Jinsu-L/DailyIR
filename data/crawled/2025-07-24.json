        "abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) methods predominantly leverage overlapping\nusers to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a target domain. However,\nthrough empirical studies, we uncover a critical bias inherent in these\napproaches: while overlapping users experience significant enhancements in\nrecommendation quality, non-overlapping users benefit minimally and even face\nperformance degradation. This unfairness may erode user trust, and,\nconsequently, negatively impact business engagement and revenue. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel solution that generates virtual source-domain\nusers for non-overlapping target-domain users. Our method utilizes a dual\nattention mechanism to discern similarities between overlapping and\nnon-overlapping users, thereby synthesizing realistic virtual user embeddings.\nWe further introduce a limiter component that ensures the generated virtual\nusers align with real-data distributions while preserving each user's unique\ncharacteristics. Notably, our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly\nintegrated into any CDR model. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three\npublic datasets with five CDR baselines demonstrate that our method effectively\nmitigates the CDR non-overlapping user bias, without loss of overall accuracy.\nOur code is publicly available at https://github.com/WeixinChen98/VUG.",

        "abstract": "As frontier language models increasingly saturate standard QA benchmarks,\nconcerns about data contamination, memorization, and escalating dataset\ncreation costs persist. We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that\ntransforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where\none model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and\ndefends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the\ncorrect solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach\nsubstantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet\nreuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions:\n(1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based\nassessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's\neffectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized\nprotocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of\nthe method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model\nfine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%)\nbut performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can\nreliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based\nevaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a\nfraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks. Overall, our framework\nunderscores that \"pretraining on the test set is no longer all you need,\"\noffering a sustainable path for measuring the genuine reasoning ability of\nadvanced language models.",

        "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from\ncomputational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge:\npredicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert\nactivation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address\nthis gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the\ncomputational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to\nsystematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural\nconfigurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the\nexpert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following\npredictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator\nwith a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified\nscaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its\nconfiguration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained\nLing-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active\nparameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an\nidentical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance\nof the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources,\nthereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a\nprincipled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE\nmodels.",

Despite the remarkable progress,\nstate-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at\ninference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their\nrobustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose\nD2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust\nvision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text\nand a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which\nnaturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic\ncues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and\nreconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich\ncross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate\ntraining-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss\nthat enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.\nExtensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves\nsuperior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\napproaches.",

We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy\nOptimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following (\"player\") and reward\nmodeling (\"referee\") within a single model and a single training phase. Our\nmethod recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable\nreasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format\noptimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This\nenables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic\nwhile simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.\nExperiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified\nmodel significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative\nreward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24\nto 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an\ninference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort\nfor parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model\narchitecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different\nbenefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity\ncalculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To\naddress this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by\ncombining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding\nRAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects\nretrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity;\nhowever, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG\ngenerates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then\nselects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average\nimprovements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG,\nrespectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models\nindicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various\ndomains.

At the level of novel insights, our regression\nanalysis uncovers different patterns of impact of subjective features on the\ntwo facets of argument strength encoded in the datasets. Our results show that\nstorytelling and hedging have contrasting effects on objective and subjective\nargument quality, while the influence of emotions depends on their rhetoric\nutilization rather than the domain.",

To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic\nmodeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space\nlearning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of\nEuclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block\nand Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces,\nusing the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features.\nAdditionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce \"text <\nvideo\" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further\nenhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video\ncontent and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. Code is released at\nhttps://github.com/lijun2005/ICCV25-HLFormer.",

While deep\nlearning models have improved optical-assisted diagnostics, they often demand\nextensive labeled datasets and yield \"black-box\" outputs with limited\ninterpretability. In this paper, we propose EndoFinder, an online polyp\nretrieval framework that leverages multi-view scene representations for\nexplainable and scalable CRC diagnosis. First, we develop a Polyp-aware Image\nEncoder by combining contrastive learning and a reconstruction task, guided by\npolyp segmentation masks. This self-supervised approach captures robust\nfeatures without relying on large-scale annotated data. Next, we treat each\npolyp as a three-dimensional \"scene\" and introduce a Scene Representation\nTransformer, which fuses multiple views of the polyp into a single latent\nrepresentation. By discretizing this representation through a hashing layer,\nEndoFinder enables real-time retrieval from a compiled database of historical\npolyp cases, where diagnostic information serves as interpretable references\nfor new queries. We evaluate EndoFinder on both public and newly collected\npolyp datasets for re-identification and pathology classification.

With large\nlanguage models (LLMs) increasingly revolutionizing evaluation methodologies\nacross various human annotation tasks, we are inspired to explore a core\nresearch proposition: Can LLMs effectively simulate human users for serendipity\nevaluation? To address this question, we conduct a meta-evaluation on two\ndatasets derived from real user studies in the e-commerce and movie domains,\nfocusing on three key aspects: the accuracy of LLMs compared to conventional\nproxy metrics, the influence of auxiliary data on LLM comprehension, and the\nefficacy of recently popular multi-LLM techniques. Our findings indicate that\neven the simplest zero-shot LLMs achieve parity with, or surpass, the\nperformance of conventional metrics.

To address this, we introduce the Moral\nDilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a\ndistribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a\nfree-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional\nalignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across\ndilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high\nconsensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In\nparallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions\nextracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral\nvalues than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch\nin both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap,\nwe introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method\nthat conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles.

Given a\nlarge input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small \"pattern\" graph indicative of\nspecial local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of\nthis pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif\ncounting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a \"triadic\" query. Recent\nwork has focused on \"temporal graph mining\", where the network $G$ has edges\nwith timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints.\n  Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of\n\"thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis\" for massive temporal\nnetworks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three\nvertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An \"FOL\" motif query is obtained\nby having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows\nfor query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical\ntriadic query would be \"find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they\nform a triangle within one hour\". A thresholded FOL query can express \"find all\npairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$\nalso formed an edge within an hour\".\n  We design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic\nqueries. The theoretical running time of FOLTY matches the best known running\ntime for temporal triangle counting in sparse graphs. We give an efficient\nimplementation of FOLTY using specialized temporal data structures. FOLTY has\nexcellent empirical behavior, and can answer triadic FOL queries on graphs with\nnearly 70M edges is less than hour on commodity hardware.

However, their multi-step,\nmulti-tool collaboration capabilities in the financial sector remain\nunderexplored. This paper introduces FinGAIA, an end-to-end benchmark designed\nto evaluate the practical abilities of AI agents in the financial domain.\nFinGAIA comprises 407 meticulously crafted tasks, spanning seven major\nfinancial sub-domains: securities, funds, banking, insurance, futures, trusts,\nand asset management. These tasks are organized into three hierarchical levels\nof scenario depth: basic business analysis, asset decision support, and\nstrategic risk management. We evaluated 10 mainstream AI agents in a zero-shot\nsetting. The best-performing agent, ChatGPT, achieved an overall accuracy of\n48.9\\%, which, while superior to non-professionals, still lags financial\nexperts by over 35 percentage points. Error analysis has revealed five\nrecurring failure patterns: Cross-modal Alignment Deficiency, Financial\nTerminological Bias, Operational Process Awareness Barrier, among others. These\npatterns point to crucial directions for future research.

Disentangled representation learning\nprovides an effective solution to model complex user preferences by separating\nintra-domain features (domain-shared and domain-specific features), thereby\nenhancing robustness and interpretability. However, disentanglement-based CDR\nmethods employing generative modeling or GNNs with contrastive objectives face\ntwo key challenges: (i) pre-separation strategies decouple features before\nextracting collaborative signals, disrupting intra-domain interactions and\nintroducing noise; (ii) unsupervised disentanglement objectives lack explicit\ntask-specific guidance, resulting in limited consistency and suboptimal\nalignment. To address these challenges, we propose DGCDR, a GNN-enhanced\nencoder-decoder framework. To handle challenge (i), DGCDR first applies GNN to\nextract high-order collaborative signals, providing enriched representations as\na robust foundation for disentanglement. The encoder then dynamically\ndisentangles features into domain-shared and -specific spaces, preserving\ncollaborative information during the separation process.

This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded\nmetrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping\nmodel evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise\ncomparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans.

        "abstract": "Accessing knowledge via multilingual natural-language interfaces is one of\nthe emerging challenges in the field of information retrieval and related ones.\nStructured knowledge stored in knowledge graphs can be queried via a specific\nquery language (e.g., SPARQL). Therefore, one needs to transform\nnatural-language input into a query to fulfill an information need. Prior\napproaches mostly focused on combining components (e.g., rule-based or\nneural-based) that solve downstream tasks and come up with an answer at the\nend. We introduce mKGQAgent, a human-inspired framework that breaks down the\ntask of converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries into modular,\ninterpretable subtasks. By leveraging a coordinated LLM agent workflow for\nplanning, entity linking, and query refinement - guided by an experience pool\nfor in-context learning - mKGQAgent efficiently handles multilingual KGQA.\nEvaluated on the DBpedia- and Corporate-based KGQA benchmarks within the\nText2SPARQL challenge 2025, our approach took first place among the other\nparticipants. This work opens new avenues for developing human-like reasoning\nsystems in multilingual semantic parsing.",

        "title": "LLM4MEA: Data-free Model Extraction Attacks on Sequential Recommenders via Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of sequential recommender\nsystems to Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs). MEAs collect responses from\nrecommender systems to replicate their functionality, enabling unauthorized\ndeployments and posing critical privacy and security risks. Black-box attacks\nin prior MEAs are ineffective at exposing recommender system vulnerabilities\ndue to random sampling in data selection, which leads to misaligned synthetic\nand real-world distributions. To overcome this limitation, we propose LLM4MEA,\na novel model extraction method that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as\nhuman-like rankers to generate data. It generates data through interactions\nbetween the LLM ranker and target recommender system. In each interaction, the\nLLM ranker analyzes historical interactions to understand user behavior, and\nselects items from recommendations with consistent preferences to extend the\ninteraction history, which serves as training data for MEA. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that LLM4MEA significantly outperforms existing\napproaches in data quality and attack performance, reducing the divergence\nbetween synthetic and real-world data by up to 64.98% and improving MEA\nperformance by 44.82% on average. From a defensive perspective, we propose a\nsimple yet effective defense strategy and identify key hyperparameters of\nrecommender systems that can mitigate the risk of MEAs.",

        "title": "Harnessing RLHF for Robust Unanswerability Recognition and Trustworthy Response Generation in LLMs",
        "abstract": "Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) systems, while offering intuitive\naccess to information, face a significant challenge: reliably handling\nunanswerable questions to prevent the generation of misleading or hallucinated\ncontent. Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can\nintroduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models\n(LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a\nnovel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within\nthe LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning\nframework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention\ngeneration for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a\nconfidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)\nphase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards\nappropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge\nboundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built\nC-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines,\nincluding hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly\nanswering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms\nSALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate\nabstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination,\ndemonstrating its ability to robustly \"know when to say 'I don't know'.\"",

In partnership with Penda Health, a network of primary\ncare clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, we studied AI Consult, a tool that serves as a\nsafety net for clinicians by identifying potential documentation and clinical\ndecision-making errors. AI Consult integrates into clinician workflows,\nactivating only when needed and preserving clinician autonomy. We conducted a\nquality improvement study, comparing outcomes for 39,849 patient visits\nperformed by clinicians with or without access to AI Consult across 15 clinics.\nVisits were rated by independent physicians to identify clinical errors.\nClinicians with access to AI Consult made relatively fewer errors: 16% fewer\ndiagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors. In absolute terms, the\nintroduction of AI Consult would avert diagnostic errors in 22,000 visits and\ntreatment errors in 29,000 visits annually at Penda alone. In a survey of\nclinicians with AI Consult, all clinicians said that AI Consult improved the\nquality of care they delivered, with 75% saying the effect was \"substantial\".\nThese results required a clinical workflow-aligned AI Consult implementation\nand active deployment to encourage clinician uptake. We hope this study\ndemonstrates the potential for LLM-based clinical decision support tools to\nreduce errors in real-world settings and provides a practical framework for\nadvancing responsible adoption.",
