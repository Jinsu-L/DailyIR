        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by\nincorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized\nrelevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In\ncontrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the\nusefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical\nevidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high\ncomputational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of\npassages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries\nrequiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to\ndistill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient\nmodels. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,\nenabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the\nneed for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer\ngeneration and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window\nmethod that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution\nfor RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer\nquality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher\nmodel for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into\nRankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex\nquestions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in\nenhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking\nand utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting\nfurther research in this area.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in\nnatural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with\ninformation retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and\ncontextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of\nRAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question\nanswering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse\napplications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG,\nparticularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in\nparametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms,\nsequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in\ndetail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends,\nproviding insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the\ndeployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges\nrelated to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A\ncomparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking\nperformance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and\ncomputational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality,\nprivacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally,\nthe review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval\napproaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and\nagentic RAG architectures.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.\nHowever, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e.,\nlow-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is\ncritical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have\nequipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing\nthem to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by\nthis ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that\nexplicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming\nto enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We\nvalidate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the\nretriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA\ndatasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG\nperformance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,\nwhere the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,\nwhere it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently\nimproves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can\nalso effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that\nincorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for\nbuilding more robust RAG systems.

        "abstract": "Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs),\nhave achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns.\nHowever, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to\nover-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and\ncompromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel\nregularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in\ngraph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional\ntraining objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,\nthereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more\npersonalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive\n(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the\ncontribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We\nfurther explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed\npopularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach\nflexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be\nseamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as\nLightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as\ndemonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU)\nand Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even\nenhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results\nhighlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the\noptimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing\naccuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.",

Second, existing evaluations are often\ninadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full\nspectrum of real world medical tasks.\n  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned\non diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across\nmultiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.\n  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks\nspanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled\non the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of\nmedical text.

        "abstract": "Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where\nitems with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due\nto the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage\nitem metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use\nembeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as\ninitialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content\nembeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt\nto the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can\ndegrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far\nfrom their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to\naddress this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or\nfine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen\nembeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting\nthem go too far from their original semantic structure.

        "abstract": "Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text\nmining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph\nconstruction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific\ntraining and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving\nbiomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method\nthat does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three\nstages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging\nstrategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through\nprompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show\nthat AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both\nmention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art\nmethods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive\ncapability and generalizability to new ontologies.",

        "abstract": "Existing retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) methods typically use an\nexternal retrieval module to fetch semantically similar code snippets used for\ngenerating subsequent fragments. However, even for consecutive code fragments,\nthe content often diverges due to logical progression, resulting in a content\ngap. This gap undermines the performance of current RACG methods, as\n\\textit{external} retrieval modules based on content matching fail to infer the\nspecific information need of LLMs to generate the next code fragment.\nTherefore, we propose \\textbf{SelfRACG}, a novel paradigm that enables large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to \\textbf{Self}-express their information needs to\nenhance \\textbf{RACG}. Specifically, SelfRACG includes an information need\nexpression module and a two-stage information need-guided training strategy,\nwhich encourages LLMs to express their information need. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SelfRACG can retrieve external knowledge that better aligns\nwith the LLM's own information needs, resulting in superior generation\nperformance compared to vanilla RACG.",

We argue\nthat the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer\nlearning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,\nscalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt\noptimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn\nhigh-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or\nmore LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool\ncalls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose\nproblems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons\nfrom the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it\ncan often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four\ntasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up\nto 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,\nMIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an\ninference-time search strategy for code optimization.",

While\nempirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple\nobjective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work\nintroduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to\ndeconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the\nsingle-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category\nStoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,\nallows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes\nthree main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic\nrationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,\nquantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods\nexploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn\nnot just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a\nprocess we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we\nprove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive\nlearning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,\nwe show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align\nwith the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a\ngeometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This\ncompositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural\nprinciples underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:\nhttps://github.com/asiresearch/lm-theory",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based\nalignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker\nDiarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy.\nMisalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of\nmultimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational\ncontexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing\npre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing\ntimestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal\napproach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio\nembeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating\nmechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset\ndemonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy,\noutperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight\nthe critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness\nin enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation\nfor robust multimodal emotion analysis.",

        "abstract": "Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an\nincreasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced\nmodel training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public\nbenchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair\ncomparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments.\nExisting benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases\npermanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or\nrepeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches\nfail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency\nsimultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains\nunquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic\nevaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography.\nArxivRoll comprises two key components: \\emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and\nPrediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \\emph{ii)\nRugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark\ncontamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new\nbenchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them\nfor one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of\ncurrent LLMs. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/liangzid/ArxivRoll/.",

Prior\ntool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a\nsingle tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math\nreasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with\nmore complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.\nTo address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool\nAGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG\nguides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It\nthen aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning\nprocess, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a\nfinetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any\nLLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally\nexpensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned\nwith custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:\nMATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and\nclosed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%\nto 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.",

A core aspect of MABs is the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to\nbe enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear\nbandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the\nsame linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration\nstrategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is\nincreasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration\nbehavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of\nseveral linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy\nlinear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier\nperformance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This\nobservation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which\nconsistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that\npure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.\nOur results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for\nbandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory\nefficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for\ndeveloping more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations\ninto alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender\nsystems.",

        "title": "Advancing Event Forecasting through Massive Training of Large Language Models: Challenges, Solutions, and Broader Impacts",
        "abstract": "Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast\ndoubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved\nevaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching\nsuperforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been\nreported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how\nthese technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to\nsociety in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths\nand considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,\naiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.",

        "title": "Smooth Reading: Bridging the Gap of Recurrent LLM to Self-Attention LLM on Long-Context Tasks",
        "abstract": "Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear\ncomputational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to\nself-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic\ncomplexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope\nour method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further\nprogress, we will release code and dataset.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like\nunits and clustering these to create a lexicon. Prior work can be categorized\ninto two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then\ncluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods\nincorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection.\nHowever, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve\nsegmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in\nwhether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up\nstrategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent\nself-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a\nlexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic\nprogramming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On\nthe five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable\nstate-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times\nfaster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of\nES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate\nboundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as\nwell. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor.\nTherefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering\ntechniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations.

        "abstract": "The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of\ndomains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes\nand contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and\nprofessional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to\nungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a\nstructured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three\ndifferent professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a\nhierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive\ngrammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current\nLLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular\nLLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google\nGemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600\nresponses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate\nstereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'\npronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in\nAI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in\nthe workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.\nUnderstanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and\nassuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather\ncontribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include\nexpanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt\nengineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.",

        "title": "Semantic IDs for Music Recommendation",
        "abstract": "Training recommender systems for next-item recommendation often requires\nunique embeddings to be learned for each item, which may take up most of the\ntrainable parameters for a model. Shared embeddings, such as using content\ninformation, can reduce the number of distinct embeddings to be stored in\nmemory. This allows for a more lightweight model; correspondingly, model\ncomplexity can be increased due to having fewer embeddings to store in memory.\nWe show the benefit of using shared content-based features ('semantic IDs') in\nimproving recommendation accuracy and diversity, while reducing model size, for\ntwo music recommendation datasets, including an online A/B test on a music\nstreaming service.",

        "title": "Evaluating Code-Mixing in LLMs Across 18 Languages",
        "abstract": "Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a\nconversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language\nprocessing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by\nnarrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the\ncode-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the\nsignificance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this\ncontext remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating\ncode-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from\nseven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating\nsynthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.\nOur analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets\ninvolving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training\ndata size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.",
