        "abstract": "Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and\nClaude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems,\nincluding retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents.\nIn these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often\nconsisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and\ngenerates a response that is contextually grounded by following the\ninstruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset\nof texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the\nLLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including\nperforming post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and\ntrustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,\nstate-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation\ncost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a\nsingle response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context\ntraceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a\nprompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques\ndesigned to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical\ninsights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for\nAttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and\nefficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also\nshow that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt\ninjection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection\nparadigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can\neffectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate\nLLM-generated reviews.

        "abstract": "Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models\n(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but\nalso serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation\nframeworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer\nverification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules\nor evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current\nmethodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically\nevaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent\nstage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the\nrobustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across\ndifferent domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and\nrobust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It\ndemonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse\nreasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including\nmulti-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively\nidentifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark\ncomprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented\nthrough manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier.

This design approach\nemphasizes the designers' vision for how the system can best serve the\ninterests of users, providers, businesses, and other stakeholders. Although\ndesigners may be well-informed about user needs through user experience and\nmarket research, they are still the arbiters of the system's design and\nevaluation, with other stakeholders' interests less emphasized in user-centered\ndesign and evaluation. When extended to recommender systems for social good,\nthis approach results in systems that reflect the social objectives as\nenvisioned by the designers and evaluated as the designers understand them.\nInstead, social goals and operationalizations should be developed through\nparticipatory and democratic processes that are accountable to their\nstakeholders. We argue that recommender systems aimed at improving social good\nshould be designed *by* and *with*, not just *for*, the people who will\nexperience their benefits and harms.

This paper\npresents RED, an automated recommendation system designed for iFood, Latin\nAmerica's largest on-demand food delivery platform, to personalize the\nselection of curated food collections displayed to millions of users. Our\napproach employs a LightGBM classifier that scores collections based on three\nfeature groups: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and\ncontextual information. To address the cold-start problem of recommending newly\ncreated collections, we develop content-based representations using item\nembeddings and implement monotonicity constraints to improve generalization. We\ntackle data scarcity by bootstrapping from category carousel interactions and\naddress visibility bias through unbiased sampling of impressions and purchases\nin production. The system demonstrates significant real-world impact through\nextensive A/B testing with 5-10% of iFood's user base.

        "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems,\nestimates user click likelihood using historical behavioral data. Modeling user\nbehavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has\ngained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual\nmodeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior\nsequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty\nseparators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM\npre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention\nscatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior\nboundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.\nTo address this, we propose $\\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing\nbehavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired\nby attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically\nregulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we\ninsert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating\nrecommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable\nattention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy\nthat explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink\nmechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral\ncorrelations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source\ndatasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the\nmethod's effectiveness across scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the\nauthority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning\nevaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground\ntruth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,\namong whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has\nstudied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as\nis typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of\nitems ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable\nmachine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical\ndatasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated\ndistributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$\nconfiguration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation\ndata and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our\nfindings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N\n\\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested\non at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always\noccurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and\n$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics\nthat are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better\nat higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get\nmore effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and\nannotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.",

Additionally, we apply\ncommunity detection techniques, which are able to identify distinct clusters\npartisanship, topics, and misinformation, highlighting the complex dynamics of\ninformation spread on social media.

        "abstract": "Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in\nhow users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain\ninsight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated\ncontent are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other\nmemes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called\nMeme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,\nmost existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual\nbackground, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme\nmatching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude\nthe many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of\nautomated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to\ncontemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader\nformulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show\nthat conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise\ncomputation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes\nbut fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the\nsegment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image\nmeasures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a\nprompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for\nmeme matching.

However, the\nintegration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative,\nintroduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination\nproblems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse\ndistribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical\nrelationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that\nlead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose\nMultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source\nretrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our\nframework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module\nthat employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical\nrelationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the\nsparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that\nimplements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both\ngraph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable\ninformation nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source\ninconsistencies.

        "abstract": "Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language\nModels (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as\nmathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can\nbe viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate\ncase of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This\ncontrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),\nwhich require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that\nresponds to each action with a non-trivial observation.\n  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this\ngeneral regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)\nalgorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world\nsoftware engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on\nthe SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to\n39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches\nor outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and\nQwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward\nbuilding more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based\non open models.",

Recent advancements aim to address\nthis limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,\nabstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.\nThis paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by\nexamining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.\nContrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous\nexploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs\npredominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during\nsubsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different\nreasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,\nobscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.\nTo tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce\n\\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the\nGumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness\ncan alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential\nof Soft Thinking.

Accordingly, automatically distinguishing\nmisinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an\nincreasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a\nstatic learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links,\nand propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels.\nHowever, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world\nscenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically\nevolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\nframework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental\nRepresentations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social\nenvironmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to\npredict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the\ntemporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained\ndynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM,\nMISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER,\nwe compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the\nexperimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.",

We\nfirst identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical\nreasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic\nreasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach\ncomprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,\nperforms symbolic reasoning.

To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.",

While prior research\nhas primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,\ntheir potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To\nfill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),\na new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two\nreasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.\nSpecifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:\none in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of\nThinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,\nusing a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both\ncandidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\\%\nin GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,\nresulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms\nfew-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer\nrobustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to\ntraining-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on\nout-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the\ncalibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes\nconsistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural\nthinking diversity.

In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\\emph{i.e.},\nlimited text tokens \\emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.\nHowever, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during\nquantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.\nMotivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ\nframework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token\nredundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an\nenhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining\ncompatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and\neffectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise\nbackward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.\nExtensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit\nsettings. For example, it achieves a substantial \\textbf{16.45\\%} improvement\non MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.",

        "abstract": "Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for\nenhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra\ntraining. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and\nSelf-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model\n(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling\n(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent\nCollaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination\nof LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model\ncollaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a\ncurated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to\nselect the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking\n(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that\nthe proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be\nreleased at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.",

To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation\nprotocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision\nScoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to\nresolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware\nRetrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to\nquantify order uncertainty of tied candidates.

        "abstract": "Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also\naccelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To\nensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond\nefficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches\nlargely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation\nrules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we\npropose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that\nintroduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term \"Hierarchical\"\nreflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation\npipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a\nstronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical\ntaxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based\nclassification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained\nlevels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard\ndirectly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further\nenhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level\nsoft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),\npenalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation\nquality.

        "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different\napplications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in\nvarious tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using\nexplicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion\nand short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit\nforms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,\nwe investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in\npsychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of\nnarrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories\ncontaining short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or\nsix) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related\nstory endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story\nchanges in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)\nWhile models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned\nprompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes\nmitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same\ngender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias\nand female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological\nground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with\nmodel size.

As a result, researchers have attempted to\nadapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing\nextra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the\nsuperior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their\nbase KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this\npaper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods\nand then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our\nresults show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of\nHKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods\nalter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.\nMoreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in\ncapturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate\nmain-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.\nTo further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE\nresearch, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a\nqualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based\ngraph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an\nimproved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to\nmitigate compression issues.

To\nanswer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues\nto the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue\ncorpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly\nconverge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative\nto the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,\nwe observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with\ninstruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained\ncounterparts.

Consequently, they\noften impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old\nknowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To\naddress this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method\nfor CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight\nperspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling\noperation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by\nconsolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we\ndynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old\nknowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a\nweight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover,\nwe develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current\nnon-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the\nsemantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has\nlargely been ignored by previous methods.

        "abstract": "Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with\ndepression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals\nreport somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are\nincreasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by\nprompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely\nfail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in\nmajor Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment\nin several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this\nfailure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong,\nculturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These\nfindings reveal that while prompt language is important, current\ngeneral-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for\nsafe and effective mental health applications.",

This approach\nencourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering\ngeneralizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.\nExtensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate\nremarkable performance improvements across various model scales.

To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model\ncomprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most\nimportant memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory\nstorage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To\nincorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle\nframework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain\nfactors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates\nthe similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by\nbuilding a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we\nestablish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction\nthrough dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it\nremains consistent and logical.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.\nHowever, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are\nsusceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information\nthrough generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a\nlightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian\nnoise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based\nscreening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity\nestimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration\nto balance privacy with generation quality. A \\renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)\naccountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit\nper-response $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.\nUnlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is\nmodel-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving\nresponse utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based\ndefenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in\nRAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy\nsolutions in sensitive domains.

In this\ncontext, we identify two key challenges: (i) insufficient integration of\nanomaly detection (AD) knowledge during pre-training, and (ii) the lack of\ntechnically precise and conte-aware language generation for anomaly reasoning.\nTo address these issues, we propose ADSeeker, an anomaly task assistant\ndesigned to enhance inspection performance through knowledge-grounded\nreasoning.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or\nimperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy\nstability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on\nkey words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward\ndenoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the\nvalue model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value\nmodel is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and\nenabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric\nframework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two\ncore designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a\nfrozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These\nmechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture\nkey words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a\npassive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math\nreasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and\nmodel-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO\nbaselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value\nmodel in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy\noptimization in noisy real-world environments.",

        "abstract": "While scaling laws promise significant performance gains for recommender\nsystems, efficiently deploying hyperscale models remains a major unsolved\nchallenge. In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as\nnatural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender\nsystems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from\nonline streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to\ndifferent recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream\ntasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational\nconstraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert\nParadigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale\nrecommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,\ncross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This\nknowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight,\nsurface-specific ``expert\" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to\nadapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.\nTo meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a\nproduction-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving,\nlogging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now\ndeployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating\nonline metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while\nimproving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of\na Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven,\ncompute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of\nscaling laws in recommender systems.",

This paper investigates (1) whether\noff-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or\nsimulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether\nsuch models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this\nend, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the\nRoom-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both\nlow-level and panoramic action spaces.

To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal\nReasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense\nreasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference\nmechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,\ngenerating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework\nintegrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking\ndown problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for\ncontextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating\nlogical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative\nRefinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built\nupon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning\n(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source\nLVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It\nattains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline\nby +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning\nscenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the\ncritical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative\nrefinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.",

Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an\nelementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step.\nFrom a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge\nmay be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions\n(e.g., \"eat apples\"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns (\"red boat\"); and\n(3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions (\"laptop behind the sofa\").\nHere, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences\nwith increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed\nbehavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as\npotentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective\nimpairment.

For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and\nevaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by\ndesign. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible\ninstantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of\ncorrectness, relevance, and response quality.

        "title": "Large Reasoning Models Are Autonomous Jailbreak Agents",
        "abstract": "Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has\ntraditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human\nexpertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large\nreasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an\ninexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities\nof four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as\nautonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely\nused target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before\nproceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We\nperformed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of\n70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack\nsuccess rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an\nalignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety\nguardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align\nfrontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them\nfrom being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.",
