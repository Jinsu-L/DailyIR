        "abstract": "Collaborative dialogue relies on participants incrementally establishing\ncommon ground, yet in asymmetric settings they may believe they agree while\nreferring to different entities. We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme\nfor the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures\nspeaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression,\nenabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over\ntime. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k\nannotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the\nresulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings\nare rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies\nsystematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask\nreferential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an\nanalytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating\n(V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative\ndialogue.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit\nconspiratorial tendencies, whether they display sociodemographic biases in this\ndomain, and how easily they can be conditioned into adopting conspiratorial\nperspectives. Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of\nmisinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a\ncritical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are\nincreasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known\nabout whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a\nconspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated\npsychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under\ndifferent prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs\nshow partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning\nwith socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent\ndemographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses\ntoward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs\nto manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive\ncontexts. These results highlight the importance of critically evaluating the\npsychological dimensions embedded in LLMs, both to advance computational social\nscience and to inform possible mitigation strategies against harmful uses.",

        "abstract": "To foster trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union,\nthe AI Act requires providers to mark and detect the outputs of their\ngeneral-purpose models. The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods\nthat are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet,\nthe rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards\ncan be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses\nthis challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the\nmultiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct\nconcepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking\nCategorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods\naccording to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,\nduring, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2)\nWatermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping\neach criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and\ndetectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since\ninteroperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we\npropose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking\nComparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the\noperationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all\nfour standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further\nresearch into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture\nof LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward\nunseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design.",

To address this, we introduce\nLiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in\nrealistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles:\n(i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on\noffline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing\nreal-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends\ncontrol from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk\nmanagement and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across\nstructurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction\nmarkets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each\nstep, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs\npercentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we\nrun 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1)\nhigh LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display\ndistinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and\n(3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These\nfindings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence,\nmotivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency\nunder live uncertainty.",

In this paper, we demonstrate, for the\nfirst time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in\nhuman-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements:\nstack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer,\nsimple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack\nof Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed\nby DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic\nstacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question\nformation task.

        "abstract": "Understanding how well large language models can follow users' instructions\nthroughout a dialogue spanning multiple topics is of great importance for\ndata-intensive conversational applications. Existing benchmarks are often\nlimited to a fixed number of turns, making them susceptible to saturation and\nfailing to account for the user's interactive experience. In this work, we\npropose an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following\nability. At its core, our framework decouples linguistic surface forms from\nuser intent simulation through a three-layer mechanism that tracks constraints,\ninstructions, and topics. This framework mimics User-LLM interaction by\nenabling the dynamic construction of benchmarks with state changes and\ntracebacks, terminating a conversation only when the model exhausts a simulated\nuser's patience. We define a suite of metrics capturing the quality of the\ninteraction process. Using this framework, we construct EvolIF, an evolving\ninstruction-following benchmark incorporating nine distinct constraint types.\nOur results indicate that GPT-5 exhibits superior instruction-following\nperformance. It sustains an average of 18.54 conversational turns and\ndemonstrates 70.31% robustness, outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by a significant\nmargin of 11.41%, while other models lag far behind.

To address this, we introduce the\nHallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level\nhallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines\nthree evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question\nanswering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different\noperational stages of interaction.

The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns,\nwith context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations\nacross different context scales and task complexities.

Such methods often overlook\ndeeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive\nfairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work,\nwe introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences\nencoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by\nsafety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases\noften relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which\npresent limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with\nadditional biases.

To\nsystematically identify and evaluate these growing developments, this review\nproposed six research questions (RQs), according to the preferred reporting\nitems for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods. The objective is to\nevaluate impactful GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive\nperformance, and specialization, and to identify promising approaches for\nadvanced modeling, data-intensive discovery, and integrative biological\nanalysis. RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics\nsubfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling),\nwhich demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern\nrecognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model\narchitectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to\ntargeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant\nbenefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data\nintegration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis.\nRQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and\nsynthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests\nthe main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that\nimpact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust\nevaluation and biologically grounded modeling. RQ6 examines that molecular\ndatasets (such as UniProtKB and ProteinNet12), cellular datasets (such as\nCELLxGENE and GTEx) and textual resources (such as PubMedQA and OMIM) broadly\nsupport the training and generalization of GenAI models.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of open-access (OA) publications has intensified the\nchallenge of identifying relevant scientific papers. Due to privacy constraints\nand limited access to user interaction data, recent efforts have shifted toward\ncontent-based recommendation, which relies solely on textual information.\nHowever, existing models typically treat papers as unstructured text,\nneglecting their discourse organization and thereby limiting semantic\ncompleteness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose\nOMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective,\nMethod, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning,\nand structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style\nsummarization module converts raw papers into structured and\ndiscourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives\nalign semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels.\nThe final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through\ncontextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly\nconstructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in\nPrecision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that\nQA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete\nrepresentations. Overall, OMRC-MR provides a unified and interpretable\ncontent-based paradigm for scientific paper recommendation, advancing\ntrustworthy and privacy-aware scholarly information retrieval.",

        "abstract": "The oracle problem refers to the inability of an agent to know if the\ninformation coming from an oracle is authentic and unbiased. In ancient times,\nphilosophers and historians debated on how to evaluate, increase, and secure\nthe reliability of oracle predictions, particularly those from Delphi, which\npertained to matters of state. Today, we refer to data carriers for automatic\nmachines as oracles, but establishing a secure channel between these oracles\nand the real world still represents a challenge. Despite numerous efforts, this\nproblem remains mostly unsolved, and the recent advent of blockchain oracles\nhas added a layer of complexity because of the decentralization of blockchains.\nThis paper conceptually connects Delphic and modern blockchain oracles,\ndeveloping a comparative framework. Leveraging blockchain oracle taxonomy,\nlexical analysis is also performed on 167 Delphic queries to shed light on the\nrelationship between oracle answer quality and question type. The presented\nframework aims first at revealing commonalities between classical and\ncomputational oracles and then at enriching the oracle analysis within each\nfield. This study contributes to the computer science literature by proposing\nstrategies to improve the reliability of blockchain oracles based on insights\nfrom Delphi and to classical literature by introducing a framework that can\nalso be applied to interpret and classify other ancient oracular mechanisms.",

While x86-based architectures have historically dominated this\ndomain, the increasing adoption of ARM-based servers in industry presents a\ncritical need for ANNS solutions optimized on ARM architectures. A naive port\nof existing x86 ANNS algorithms to ARM platforms results in a substantial\nperformance deficit, failing to leverage the unique capabilities of the\nunderlying hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce KScaNN, a novel\nANNS algorithm co-designed for the Kunpeng 920 ARM architecture. KScaNN\nembodies a holistic approach that synergizes sophisticated, data aware\nalgorithmic refinements with carefully-designed hardware specific\noptimizations. Its core contributions include: 1) novel algorithmic techniques,\nincluding a hybrid intra-cluster search strategy and an improved PQ residual\ncalculation method, which optimize the search process at a higher level; 2) an\nML-driven adaptive search module that provides adaptive, per-query tuning of\nsearch parameters, eliminating the inefficiencies of static configurations; and\n3) highly-optimized SIMD kernels for ARM that maximize hardware utilization for\nthe critical distance computation workloads. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that KScaNN not only closes the performance gap but establishes a\nnew standard, achieving up to a 1.63x speedup over the fastest x86-based\nsolution.

        "abstract": "Automatic evaluation of speech-to-text translation (ST) systems is typically\nperformed by comparing translation hypotheses with one or more reference\ntranslations. While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the\nlimitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from\nthe source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that\nneural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with\nhuman judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the\nsource is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments\nbetween source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct\nthe first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular\nfocus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not\navailable. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual\nproxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and\nback-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch\nbetween synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried\nout on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with\ndiverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts\nconstitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word\nerror rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a\ncomputationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT\nmetrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled\nevaluation methodologies for speech translation.",

Existing research employs red teaming evaluations,\nutilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs.\nHowever, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue\ntrajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the\nconsiderable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these\nlimitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on\ndynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process\nas a path planning problem.

        "abstract": "We revisit continual pre-training for large language models and argue that\nprogress now depends more on scaling the right structure than on scaling\nparameters alone. We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that\ninserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all\npre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies\nand increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original\nfunctionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation,\nwhich maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented\ninitialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative\nAdaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to\nacquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as\nSCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and\nSCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing\nbetween preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography\nbenchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion\nwhile still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean\ncorpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and\ncompetitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best\noverall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when\npreservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and\nadaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning\nsetups.",

Our system\ncomprises three autonomous steps: 1) a Knowledge Graph (KG) Retrieval for rapid\none-hop lookups in DBpedia, 2) an LM-based classification guided by a\ntask-specific labeling prompt, producing outputs with internal rule-based\nlogic, and 3) a Web Search Agent invoked only when KG coverage is insufficient.\nOur pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.93 on the FEVER benchmark on the\nSupported/Refuted split without task-specific fine-tuning. To address Not\nenough information cases, we conduct a targeted reannotation study showing that\nour approach frequently uncovers valid evidence for claims originally labeled\nas Not Enough Information (NEI), as confirmed by both expert annotators and LLM\nreviewers. With this paper, we present a modular, opensource fact-checking\npipeline with fallback strategies and generalization across datasets.",

We propose the Language Graph Model (LGM) to enhance conceptual clarity\nby extracting meta-relations-inheritance, alias, and composition-from natural\nlanguage. The model further employs a reflection mechanism to validate these\nmeta-relations. Leveraging a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm, these\nrelations and related descriptions are dynamically supplied to the LLM,\nimproving its ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses.\nUnlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely\non extended context windows, our method enables large language models to\nprocess texts of any length without the need for truncation.

To address this, we introduce BengaliMoralBench, the\nfirst large-scale ethics benchmark for the Bengali language and socio-cultural\ncontexts. It covers five moral domains, Daily Activities, Habits, Parenting,\nFamily Relationships, and Religious Activities, subdivided into 50 culturally\nrelevant subtopics. Each scenario is annotated via native-speaker consensus\nusing three ethical lenses: Virtue, Commonsense, and Justice ethics. We conduct\nsystematic zero-shot evaluation of prominent multilingual LLMs, including\nLlama, Gemma, Qwen, and DeepSeek, using a unified prompting protocol and\nstandard metrics. Performance varies widely (50-91% accuracy), with qualitative\nanalysis revealing consistent weaknesses in cultural grounding, commonsense\nreasoning, and moral fairness.

Ensuring the\ntrustworthiness of LLM outputs is paramount, where Uncertainty Estimation (UE)\nplays a key role. In this work, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted to\nexamine the robustness and effectiveness of diverse UE measures regarding\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in LLMs. It involves twelve different UE\nmethods and four generation quality metrics including LLMScore from LLM\ncriticizers to evaluate the uncertainty of LLM-generated answers in\nQuestion-Answering (QA) tasks on both in-distribution (ID) and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Conversely, density-based methods and the P(True) metric exhibit\nsuperior performance in OOD contexts, highlighting their effectiveness in\ncapturing the model's epistemic uncertainty.

        "abstract": "Recommender systems in multi-behavior domains, such as advertising and\ne-commerce, aim to guide users toward high-value but inherently sparse\nconversions. Leveraging auxiliary behaviors (e.g., clicks, likes, shares) is\ntherefore essential. Recent progress on generative recommendations has brought\nnew possibilities for multi-behavior sequential recommendation. However,\nexisting generative approaches face two significant challenges: 1) Inadequate\nSequence Modeling: capture the complex, cross-level dependencies within user\nbehavior sequences, and 2) Lack of Suitable Datasets: publicly available\nmulti-behavior recommendation datasets are almost exclusively derived from\ne-commerce platforms, limiting the validation of feasibility in other domains,\nwhile also lacking sufficient side information for semantic ID generation. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel generative framework, GAMER\n(Generative Augmentation and Multi-lEvel behavior modeling for Recommendation),\nbuilt upon a decoder-only backbone. GAMER introduces a cross-level interaction\nlayer to capture hierarchical dependencies among behaviors and a sequential\naugmentation strategy that enhances robustness in training. To further advance\nthis direction, we collect and release ShortVideoAD, a large-scale\nmulti-behavior dataset from a mainstream short-video platform, which differs\nfundamentally from existing e-commerce datasets and provides pretrained\nsemantic IDs for research on generative methods. Extensive experiments show\nthat GAMER consistently outperforms both discriminative and generative\nbaselines across multiple metrics.",

Yet, existing multimodal benchmarks either\noveremphasize textual reasoning or fall short of systematically capturing\nvision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving the cognitive capacity of MLLMs\ninsufficiently assessed. To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC\n(Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded\nbenchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three\nfundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and\nknowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs'\ncognitive capacity across these dimensions.

We further identify common error patterns,\nincluding orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and\npoor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that\nChain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason ->\nverify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction.

Queries and keys\ninduce an effective metric on representation space, and attention acts as a\ndiscrete connection that implements parallel transport of value vectors across\ntokens. Stacked layers provide discrete time-slices through which token\nrepresentations evolve on this curved manifold, while backpropagation plays the\nrole of a least-action principle that shapes loss-minimizing trajectories in\nparameter space. If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not\ntraverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps\nshould bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.\nTo test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence\nand the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a\nfull paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and\nlayers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat\nangles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality\nor chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe\ndeflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,\nmeaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm\nattention-induced curvature.",

        "abstract": "Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for\nautomatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic\nspatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this\nproblem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,\nadvancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions\nthat reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic\nscenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to\nlearn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,\ndegrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment\nbetween the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for\neffective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and\nvision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.\nThis shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D\nscenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address\nthis, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse\ntools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate\nalignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed\ninstructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world\nenvironments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge\nby 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with\nLEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods.\nAcross all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in\ngenerating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.",
