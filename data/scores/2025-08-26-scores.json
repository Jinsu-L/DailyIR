        "title": "Test-Time Scaling Strategies for Generative Retrieval in Multimodal Conversational Recommendations",
        "abstract": "The rapid evolution of e-commerce has exposed the limitations of traditional\nproduct retrieval systems in managing complex, multi-turn user interactions.\nRecent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those\nleveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown\npromise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios\nand struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn\ndialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as\na powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance\nthrough iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically\nrelies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical\nreasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are\nrarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are\noften ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding\nresponses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose\na novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational\nmultimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever,\nfurther augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves\nretrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent\nthroughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent\nimprovements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in\nnDCG@1.",

        "abstract": "As queries in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines powered by large\nlanguage models (LLMs) become increasingly complex and diverse, dense retrieval\nmodels have demonstrated strong performance in semantic matching. Nevertheless,\nthey often struggle with fine-grained retrieval tasks, where precise keyword\nalignment and span-level localization are required, even in cases with high\nlexical overlap that would intuitively suggest easier retrieval. To\nsystematically evaluate this limitation, we introduce two targeted tasks,\nkeyword retrieval and part-of-passage retrieval, designed to simulate practical\nfine-grained scenarios. Motivated by these observations, we propose\nLexSemBridge, a unified framework that enhances dense query representations\nthrough fine-grained, input-aware vector modulation. LexSemBridge constructs\nlatent enhancement vectors from input tokens using three paradigms: Statistical\n(SLR), Learned (LLR), and Contextual (CLR), and integrates them with dense\nembeddings via element-wise interaction. Theoretically, we show that this\nmodulation preserves the semantic direction while selectively amplifying\ndiscriminative dimensions. LexSemBridge operates as a plug-in without modifying\nthe backbone encoder and naturally extends to both text and vision modalities.\nExtensive experiments across semantic and fine-grained retrieval tasks validate\nthe effectiveness and generality of our approach.

        "abstract": "Personalized search ranking systems are critical for driving engagement and\nrevenue in modern e-commerce and short-video platforms. While existing methods\nexcel at estimating users' broad interests based on the filtered historical\nbehaviors, they typically under-exploit explicit alignment between a user's\nreal-time intent (represented by the user query) and their past actions. In\nthis paper, we propose DiffusionGS, a novel and scalable approach powered by\ngenerative models. Our key insight is that user queries can serve as explicit\nintent anchors to facilitate the extraction of users' immediate interests from\nlong-term, noisy historical behaviors. Specifically, we formulate interest\nextraction as a conditional denoising task, where the user's query guides a\nconditional diffusion process to produce a robust, user intent-aware\nrepresentation from their behavioral sequence. We propose the User-aware\nDenoising Layer (UDL) to incorporate user-specific profiles into the\noptimization of attention distribution on the user's past actions. By reframing\nqueries as intent priors and leveraging diffusion-based denoising, our method\nprovides a powerful mechanism for capturing dynamic user interest shifts.\nExtensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nDiffusionGS over state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "As more content generated by large language models (LLMs) floods into the\nInternet, information retrieval (IR) systems now face the challenge of\ndistinguishing and handling a blend of human-authored and machine-generated\ntexts. Recent studies suggest that neural retrievers may exhibit a preferential\ninclination toward LLM-generated content, while classic term-based retrievers\nlike BM25 tend to favor human-written documents. This paper investigates the\ninfluence of LLM-generated content on term-based retrieval models, which are\nvalued for their efficiency and robust generalization across domains. Our\nlinguistic analysis reveals that LLM-generated texts exhibit smoother\nhigh-frequency and steeper low-frequency Zipf slopes, higher term specificity,\nand greater document-level diversity. These traits are aligned with LLMs being\ntrained to optimize reader experience through diverse and precise expressions.\nOur study further explores whether term-based retrieval models demonstrate\nsource bias, concluding that these models prioritize documents whose term\ndistributions closely correspond to those of the queries, rather than\ndisplaying an inherent source bias. This work provides a foundation for\nunderstanding and addressing potential biases in term-based IR systems managing\nmixed-source content.",

Results demonstrate that the variants impact how systems are\nranked and show that user profiles experience significantly different levels of\nsystem effectiveness.

        "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time\nscaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1\nintegrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning\nprocesses but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating\nunstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a\nresult, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the\nreasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical\nquestion-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical\nrequirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain\nInference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time\nscalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over\nstructured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex\nqueries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference\nchains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop\ntraversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve\ncontradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k,\nCMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o,\nTree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both\nautomatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability\nby generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to\nconcrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex\nmedical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across\ndiverse tasks, yet they face inherent limitations such as constrained\nparametric knowledge and high retraining costs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) augments the generation process by retrieving externally stored knowledge\nabsent from the models internal parameters. However, RAG methods face\nchallenges such as information loss and redundant retrievals during multi-round\nqueries, accompanying the difficulties in precisely characterizing knowledge\ngaps for complex tasks. To address these problems, we propose Retrieval\nFeedback and Memory Retrieval Augmented Generation(RFM-RAG), which transforms\nthe stateless retrieval of previous methods into stateful continuous knowledge\nmanagement by constructing a dynamic evidence pool. Specifically, our method\ngenerates refined queries describing the models knowledge gaps using relational\ntriples from questions and evidence from the dynamic evidence pool; Retrieves\ncritical external knowledge to iteratively update this evidence pool; Employs a\nR-Feedback Model to evaluate evidence completeness until convergence. Compared\nto traditional RAG methods, our approach enables persistent storage of\nretrieved passages and effectively distills key information from passages to\nconstruct clearly new queries. Experiments on three public QA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that RFM-RAG outperforms previous methods and improves overall\nsystem accuracy.",

However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios,\nprimarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational\ncomplexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To\nmitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline,\ncalled Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate\ndecoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to\nthat layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query\nand full key cache in that specified layer.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to\nsimulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain\nalignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale\nsimulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is\nthe extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such\nfeedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is\noften ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference\nalignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the\nefficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering\nmechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we\nintroduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in\nRSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data.\nOur framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate\ncognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing\nambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty\nestimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation\nsamples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using\nsuch high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes.\nExtensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the\nalignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of\nfine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when\ninteracting with RSs.

To\nautomate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,\nmethods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured\nones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like\nNL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of\nsemi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To\nthis end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured\ntable question answering using large language models.

Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables.

However,\nit remains challenging due to limited training data and ambiguous or\ninconsistent pronunciations. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-driven\nmulti-pronunciation contextual biasing method that performs zero-shot\ncontextual ASR on a pretrained Whisper model. Specifically, we leverage\ntext-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing\neach target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract\nmultiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are\ncompiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a\nshallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. After which, any recognized\nvariant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription.\nThe evaluation results on the Librispeech dataset show that our method reduces\nbiased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while\nmaintaining unbiased WER essentially unchanged.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the\nindividual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can\ndegrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length\nand content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient\nexploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence\nstage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning\nstage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing\nincreased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating\noverthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage,\ndefined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the\nend of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the\nLLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking\ntoken (e.g., \\texttt{</think>}), though these methods lack an efficient and\nprecise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP\npatterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic\nrules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D)\ndemonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving\nor enhancing reasoning accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Sequential recommendation predicts each user's next item based on their\nhistorical interaction sequence. Recently, diffusion models have attracted\nsignificant attention in this area due to their strong ability to model user\ninterest distributions. They typically generate target items by denoising\nGaussian noise conditioned on historical interactions. However, these models\nface two critical limitations. First, they exhibit high sensitivity to the\ncondition, making it difficult to recover target items from pure Gaussian\nnoise. Second, the inference process is computationally expensive, limiting\npractical deployment. To address these issues, we propose FlowRec, a simple yet\neffective sequential recommendation framework which leverages flow matching to\nexplicitly model user preference trajectories from current states to future\ninterests. Flow matching is an emerging generative paradigm, which offers\ngreater flexibility in initial distributions and enables more efficient\nsampling. Based on this, we construct a personalized behavior-based prior\ndistribution to replace Gaussian noise and learn a vector field to model user\npreference trajectories. To better align flow matching with the recommendation\nobjective, we further design a single-step alignment loss incorporating both\npositive and negative samples, improving sampling efficiency and generation\nquality. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the\nsuperiority of FlowRec over the state-of-the-art baselines.",

Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism\ntension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with\nlimited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often\nskew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically\ndifferent paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a\nstatic benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models\nasynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community\nverification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions\nsourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi\nand history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and\nbrowsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are\noften hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them\nyields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset\nand its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human\nreview to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2)\nUQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the\ngenerator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate\nsolutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts\ncollectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation\non only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already\nidentified correct answers among those that passed.

This reframed perspective points to a key path for\nbuilding superior reward models: scaling the model's comprehension boundaries.\nPursuing this path, exploratory experiments on NLI tasks demonstrate that the\nslot prediction masked language models (MLMs) incorporating contextual\nexplanations achieve significantly better performance compared to mainstream\nautoregressive models.

Unlike prior\nsynthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact\ncenter conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally\ncomplex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent\nactions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines\nstill yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and\nQA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide\ngeneration. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic\nframework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing\nreal and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation\nstrategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage\napproaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent\nchallenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in\ndisfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism.

Despite their\nubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within\nbillions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture\nand cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by\nadopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and\ndeveloping a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM\narchitectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model\nanalysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that\nwhile LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in\nspecific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose\nemergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected\ncognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical\nresults highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill\nacquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions\nand neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine\nlearning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and\nsuggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed\nlearning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.",

        "abstract": "Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and\nunderexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity,\nthe development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited\navailability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign\nlanguage data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these\ndata-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically\ndomain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic\nrichness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use\nof LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages\nLarge Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample\nselection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities\nin processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore,\nthey are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this\nlimitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural\nlanguage and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both\nEnglish and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the\nfield, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario.

One such task is Named\nEntity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying and classifying proper\nnames in text, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other\nspecific entities. NER plays a crucial role in extracting information from\nunstructured textual data, enabling downstream applications such as information\nretrieval from unstructured text.\n  Traditionally, NER is addressed using supervised machine learning approaches,\nwhich require large amounts of annotated training data. However, historical\ntexts present a unique challenge, as the annotated datasets are often scarce or\nnonexistent, due to the high cost and expertise required for manual labeling.\nIn addition, the variability and noise inherent in historical language, such as\ninconsistent spelling and archaic vocabulary, further complicate the\ndevelopment of reliable NER systems for these sources.\n  In this study, we explore the feasibility of applying LLMs to NER in\nhistorical documents using zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, which\nrequire little to no task-specific training data. Our experiments, conducted on\nthe HIPE-2022 (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities)\ndataset, show that LLMs can achieve reasonably strong performance on NER tasks\nin this setting. While their performance falls short of fully supervised models\ntrained on domain-specific annotations, the results are nevertheless promising.\nThese findings suggest that LLMs offer a viable and efficient alternative for\ninformation extraction in low-resource or historically significant corpora,\nwhere traditional supervised methods are infeasible.",

        "abstract": "Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1,\nhave recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and\nmulti-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer\nfrom overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even\nfor simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational\ninefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions\nin batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically\ncompressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource\ncompetition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation\n(DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from\nbatch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages\nbatch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model\nto allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to\ninternalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA\nenables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining\nsufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on\na wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate\nthat DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many\ncases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking\nproblem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable\ndeployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into\nfine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.",

To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image\ngeneration method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and\ninteraction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining\napproach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich\nimplicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion\nmodels to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and\nhave more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an\ninteractive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the\ninteractive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing\nglobal and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and\ndetail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of\nthe concept of interactive \"actions\" more accurate and generating images with\nmore accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network\nwhich generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging\nmulti-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network\nto fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves\nimage quality.

        "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects\nvisual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified\nsequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads\nto a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in\nsubstantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual\ninformation into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence\nlength issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within\nthe model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower\nvisual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an\nefficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and\nfusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the\ninherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and\nlanguage models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it\ndynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic\ngranularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The\nfused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being\ndirectly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding\nlayer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also\ndynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small\nnumber of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of\ncross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted\nexperiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering\non ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate\nthat DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and\ninference.",

The proposed method maps these heterogeneous elements into\ncorresponding two-dimensional latent spaces, enabling visualization of\nasymmetric relationships between the domains. The key idea is to embed the\nelements in a way that maximizes their mutual information, thereby preserving\nthe original dependency structure as much as possible. This approach can be\nnaturally extended to cases involving three or more domains, using a\ngeneralization of mutual information known as total correlation. For\ninter-domain analysis, we also propose a visualization method that assigns\ncolors to the latent spaces based on conditional probabilities, allowing users\nto explore asymmetric relationships interactively. We demonstrate the utility\nof the method through applications to an adjective-noun dataset, the NeurIPS\ndataset, and a subject-verb-object dataset, showcasing both intra- and\ninter-domain analysis.",

        "title": "Humanizing Machines: Rethinking LLM Anthropomorphism Through a Multi-Level Framework of Design",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit \\textbf{anthropomorphism}\ncharacteristics -- human-like qualities portrayed across their outlook,\nlanguage, behavior, and reasoning functions. Such characteristics enable more\nintuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on\nanthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and\nuser deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that\nanthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \\emph{concept of design} that\ncan be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple\ndisciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact\nshould reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters.\nThis interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the\ndesigners and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues\nare categorized into four dimensions: \\textit{perceptive, linguistic,\nbehavioral}, and \\textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and\neffectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers\nfor practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations\nof anthropomorphic design.",
