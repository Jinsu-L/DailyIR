### 1. T-Retrievability: A Topic-Focused Approach to Measure Fair Document Exposure in Information Retrieval

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 12
- **Authors**: Xuejun Chang, Zaiqiao Meng, Debasis Ganguly
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21704v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-08-29 15:14:16
- **Comment**: Accepted by Proceedings of the 34th ACM International Conference on
  Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2025), November 10-14, 2025,
  Seoul, Republic of Korea
- **Topic Keywords**: information retrieval, ranking, relevance, retrieval, rank
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to Information Retrieval, specifically addressing the fairness of document exposure and proposing a new measure called T-Retrievability. The focus on retrieval models and their impact on document accessibility aligns with your interests in query understanding and ranking models. While not directly related to your e-commerce background, the paper's emphasis on real-time relevance optimization and deep semantic understanding makes it a useful contribution to the field.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Exposure Bias in Information Retrieval (IR) Models
- **Aim**: To develop a novel metric, T-Retrievability, for measuring document accessibility fairness in IR models and evaluate its effectiveness across different model architectures.
- **Rationale**: Traditional retrievability scores fail to capture the nuanced nature of exposure bias, which arises from variations in document accessibility across different topic groups.
- **Ground**: The research utilizes the MS MARCO dev dataset and four classes of IR models: BM25, SPLADE, TCT-ColBERT (TCT), and BM25¬ªTCT-ColBERT (BM25¬ªTCT).
- **Experiment**: T-Retrievability is calculated using a two-pronged approach: clustering queries into groups based on topic similarity and evaluating the average retrievability of documents within each cluster. Performance is assessed using Gini coefficient, nDCG@10, and MAP.
- **Takeaway**: Significant variation in exposure bias exists across different IR models. Collection-level exposure fairness does not always align with fine-grained measures, and exposure fairness tends to decrease as topics become more specific. Future research will explore mitigating bias by adjusting document rankings based on historical exposure levels.

#### Abstract
> Retrievability of a document is a collection-based statistic that measures
its expected (reciprocal) rank of being retrieved within a specific rank
cut-off. A collection with uniformly distributed retrievability scores across
documents is an indicator of fair document exposure. While retrievability
scores have been used to quantify the fairness of exposure for a collection, in
our work, we use the distribution of retrievability scores to measure the
exposure bias of retrieval models. We hypothesise that an uneven distribution
of retrievability scores across the entire collection may not accurately
reflect exposure bias but rather indicate variations in topical relevance. As a
solution, we propose a topic-focused localised retrievability measure, which we
call \textit{T-Retrievability} (topic-retrievability), which first computes
retrievability scores over multiple groups of topically-related documents, and
then aggregates these localised values to obtain the collection-level
statistics. Our analysis using this proposed T-Retrievability measure uncovers
new insights into the exposure characteristics of various neural ranking
models. The findings suggest that this localised measure provides a more
nuanced understanding of exposure fairness, offering a more reliable approach
for assessing document accessibility in IR systems.

### 2. Unidentified and Confounded? Understanding Two-Tower Models for Unbiased Learning to Rank (Extended Abstract)

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 12
- **Authors**: Philipp Hager, Onno Zoeter, Maarten de Rijke
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21698v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-08-29 15:08:10
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, learning to rank, user behavior, click, rank, search
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Learning to Rank and user behavior modeling, specifically addressing a phenomenon in two-tower models that can impact ranking performance. The paper's focus on model identifiability issues and logging policies aligns with your interests in query understanding and real-time relevance optimization. However, the paper's scope is more focused on the specific challenges of two-tower models rather than a broader exploration of IR and NLP topics.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Performance and Identifiability Challenges of Two-Tower Models in Unbiased Learning to Rank
- **Aim**: Investigate the impact of production logging policies on the performance and identifiability of two-tower models for unbiased learning to rank.
- **Rationale**: As production logging policies become more effective, the ranking performance of two-tower models trained on these clicks decreases, raising concerns about confounding and identifiability issues.
- **Ground**: Two-tower models are a popular architecture for unbiased learning to rank, but their performance can be negatively affected by production logging policies.
- **Experiment**: Experiments demonstrate that deterministic logging policies without document swaps lead to performance decline. Theoretical analysis shows that additive two-tower models can be identified without document swaps under specific conditions (overlapping feature distributions and continuous relevance tower).
- **Takeaway**: Model misspecification, coupled with systematic correlations between model errors and logging policy behaviors, can introduce bias in parameter estimation.  Mitigating strategies include monitoring click residuals, ensuring randomized data collection, avoiding expert policy simulations, and utilizing sample weighting schemes or Inverse Probability Sampling (IPS).

#### Abstract
> Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling
biased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a
concerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by
well-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This
paper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding
effects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We
theoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,
showing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature
distributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also
investigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that
they introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However,
logging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user
behavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement
across positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these
effects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using
two-tower models.

### 3. Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network for Click-through Rate Prediction

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 9
- **Authors**: Xiaoxi Cui, Weihai Lu, Yu Tong, Yiheng Li, Zhejun Zhao
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21460v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-08-29 09:46:16
- **Comment**: SIGIR 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, click, ctr, click-through rate, recommend
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in click-through rate prediction and multi-modal synergy. The proposed framework, Diff-MSIN, addresses the limitations of existing methods and demonstrates significant improvement in multi-modal recommendation systems. Although the focus is on e-commerce, the concepts and techniques are applicable to broader IR and NLP domains.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction in Recommender Systems
- **Aim**: To develop a novel diffusion-based framework, Diff-MSIN, that effectively captures synergistic relationships between multi-modal user features (ID, text, and image) for improved CTR prediction.
- **Rationale**: Existing CTR prediction methods often struggle to fully leverage the complementary information present in multi-modal user data.
- **Ground**: Multi-modal user data (ID, text, and image) contains both common and specific information that can contribute to accurate CTR prediction.
- **Experiment**: Diff-MSIN was evaluated on the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements (at least 1.67% increase in CTR) compared to baseline models.
- **Takeaway**: Diff-MSIN, with its MFE, SRC, and FDAF modules, provides a general framework for multi-modal user interest modeling and achieves state-of-the-art results in CTR prediction.

#### Abstract
> In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to
model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods
are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to
comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is
necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing
to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate
prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle
commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to
consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex
interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based
Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through
prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal
Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,
and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC
Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different
modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,
improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among
different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the
FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To
validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive
experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results
demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least
1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing
multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following

- **Comment**: 9 pages, table and evaluations 5-9
- **Topic Keywords**: queries
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in query understanding and ranking models. The focus on code embeddings and natural language queries aligns with your interests in deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization. The application of autoregressive backbones and last-token pooling is also an interesting aspect of the paper.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Code Embedding Generation
- **Aim**: Develop efficient and high-performing code embedding models using a novel training methodology.
- **Rationale**: Existing code embedding models often rely on supervised training with limited data, leading to performance limitations. This research aims to address this by leveraging pre-trained code generation LLMs and targeted training strategies.
- **Ground**: Public code datasets (CoIR-Retrieval, CodeSearchNet, CoSQA) and synthetic datasets generated using GPT-4o (SyntheticDLTrans, Multilingual CodeChef Extension).
- **Experiment**: Training jina-code-embeddings models (JCE-0.5B and JCE-1.5B) using the described training methodology and evaluating their performance on various code-related benchmarks (MTEB-CoIR, CodeSearchNetRetrieval, CodeEditSearchRetrieval, HumanEval, MBPP, DS-1000, WikiSQL, CosQA+).
- **Takeaway**: jina-code-embeddings achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple code-related tasks, outperforming comparable models and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed training approach.

#### Abstract
> jina-code-embeddings is a novel code embedding model suite designed to
retrieve code from natural language queries, perform technical
question-answering, and identify semantically similar code snippets across
programming languages. It makes innovative use of an autoregressive backbone
pre-trained on both text and code, generating embeddings via last-token
pooling. We outline the training recipe and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance despite the relatively small size of the models, validating this
approach to code embedding model construction.

### 5. BED-LLM: Intelligent Information Gathering with LLMs and Bayesian Experimental Design

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Deepro Choudhury, Sinead Williamson, Adam Goli≈Ñski, Ning Miao, Freddie Bickford Smith, Michael Kirchhof, Yizhe Zhang, Tom Rainforth
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21184v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-08-28 19:51:43
- **Topic Keywords**: queries
- **Reason**: This paper aligns well with your interests in Information Retrieval, particularly query understanding and ranking models. The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Bayesian Experimental Design to intelligently gather information is a relevant application of IR principles. However, the focus on conversational agents and multi-turn interactions is somewhat outside your primary e-commerce domain interest.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Abstract)
- **Topic**: Enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with Intelligent Information Gathering
- **Aim**: Develop a method called BED-LLM that enables LLMs to intelligently query users or external sources for information to improve task performance.
- **Rationale**: LLMs can benefit from actively seeking relevant information rather than relying solely on in-context updates.
- **Ground**: Sequential Bayesian experimental design (BED) and probabilistic models derived from LLM belief distributions.
- **Experiment**: Evaluated BED-LLM in tasks like the 20-questions game and user preference inference, comparing it to direct prompting and other adaptive design strategies.
- **Takeaway**: BED-LLM outperforms existing methods by intelligently selecting queries to maximize information gain, leading to improved LLM performance.

#### Abstract
> We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

### 6. DMGIN: How Multimodal LLMs Enhance Large Recommendation Models for Lifelong User Post-click Behaviors

- **LLM Score**: 6
- **Keyword Score**: 9
- **Authors**: Zhuoxing Wei, Qingchen Xie, Qi Liu
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21801v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-08-29 17:28:07
- **Comment**: 8 pages, 5 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: user behavior, click, ctr, click-through rate, recommend
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, specifically in the area of user behavior modeling and click models. However, the focus on recommendation models and lifelong user post-click behaviors is not a central match to your primary research themes.

#### Abstract
> Modeling user interest based on lifelong user behavior sequences is crucial
for enhancing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. However, long post-click
behavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume
of data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training
and inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage
approaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete
utilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating
multimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents
significant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens
and mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the
model's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest
Network (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences
contain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps,
DMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete
lifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no
additional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing
multimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from
grouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors
within each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers
to capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally
ordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive
experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness
and efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that
DMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%.

### 7. QZhou-Embedding Technical Report

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 11
- **Authors**: Peng Yu, En Xu, Bin Chen, Haibiao Chen, Yinfei Xu
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21632v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-08-29 13:47:22
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, rerank, rag, retrieval, rank
- **Reason**: This paper presents a contextual text embedding model, QZhou-Embedding, which is relevant to Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the focus on text representation capabilities and data quality optimization is somewhat tangential to the user's interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are
released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we
provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

### 8. Towards On-Device Personalization: Cloud-device Collaborative Data Augmentation for Efficient On-device Language Model

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Zhaofeng Zhong, Wei Yuan, Liang Qu, Tong Chen, Hao Wang, Xiangyu Zhao, Hongzhi Yin
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21313v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-08-29 02:33:13
- **Topic Keywords**: queries, rag, personalization, search
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on developing personalized on-device language models, which is related to your interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and query understanding. However, it does not directly address your core research themes in Information Retrieval (IR) and Search technologies, particularly query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), significant progress
has been achieved in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However,
existing LLMs still face two major challenges that hinder their broader
adoption: (1) their responses tend to be generic and lack personalization
tailored to individual users, and (2) they rely heavily on cloud infrastructure
due to intensive computational requirements, leading to stable network
dependency and response delay. Recent research has predominantly focused on
either developing cloud-based personalized LLMs or exploring the on-device
deployment of general-purpose LLMs. However, few studies have addressed both
limitations simultaneously by investigating personalized on-device language
models. To bridge this gap, we propose CDCDA-PLM, a framework for deploying
personalized on-device language models on user devices with support from a
powerful cloud-based LLM. Specifically, CDCDA-PLM leverages the server-side
LLM's strong generalization capabilities to augment users' limited personal
data, mitigating the issue of data scarcity. Using both real and synthetic
data, A personalized on-device language models (LMs) is fine-tuned via
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules and deployed on users' local
devices, enabling them to process queries without depending on cloud-based
LLMs. This approach eliminates reliance on network stability and ensures high
response speeds. Experimental results across six tasks in a widely used
personalization benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of CDCDA-PLM.

### 9. Personality Matters: User Traits Predict LLM Preferences in Multi-Turn Collaborative Tasks

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Sarfaroz Yunusov, Kaige Chen, Kazi Nishat Anwar, Ali Emami
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21628v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-08-29 13:42:26
- **Comment**: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference
- **Topic Keywords**: information retrieval, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper explores user preferences for Large Language Models (LLMs) based on personality traits, which is somewhat related to user behavior modeling in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on personality-driven preferences and LLM interactions is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and click models.

#### Abstract
> As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

### 10. PiCSAR: Probabilistic Confidence Selection And Ranking

- **LLM Score**: 4

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21787v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-08-29 17:03:47
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, rank
- **Reason**: The paper PiCSAR: Probabilistic Confidence Selection And Ranking is somewhat related to the user's research interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, particularly in the context of ranking models and deep semantic understanding. However, the focus on large language models and reasoning tasks is not directly aligned with the user's primary research themes. The paper's contributions in probabilistic confidence selection and ranking are also somewhat tangential to the user's interests in query understanding and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

### 11. Reasoning-Intensive Regression

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Diane Tchuindjo, Omar Khattab
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21762v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-08-29 16:37:42
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval, search
- **Reason**: The paper discusses large language models and their application to reasoning-intensive regression, which involves deep analysis of text. While it touches on aspects of natural language processing and model optimization, it doesn't directly relate to information retrieval, search technologies, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest. The paper's focus on language models and regression tasks is somewhat relevant, but not central to the user's research themes.

#### Abstract
> AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

### 12. Breaking the Cold-Start Barrier: Reinforcement Learning with Double and Dueling DQNs

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Minda Zhao
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21259v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-08-28 23:14:07
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend, commerce, e-commerce
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on recommender systems, specifically addressing the cold-start problem, which is somewhat related to information retrieval. However, it does not directly involve query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest. The use of reinforcement learning and deep Q-Networks is an interesting application of NLP and data mining techniques, but it's not a central match to the user's primary research themes.

#### Abstract
> Recommender systems struggle to provide accurate suggestions to new users
with limited interaction history, a challenge known as the cold-user problem.
This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach using Double and Dueling
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to dynamically learn user preferences from sparse
feedback, enhancing recommendation accuracy without relying on sensitive
demographic data. By integrating these advanced DQN variants with a matrix
factorization model, we achieve superior performance on a large e-commerce
dataset compared to traditional methods like popularity-based and active
learning strategies. Experimental results show that our method, particularly
Dueling DQN, reduces Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for cold users, offering an
effective solution for privacy-constrained environments.

### 13. Summarize-Exemplify-Reflect: Data-driven Insight Distillation Empowers LLMs for Few-shot Tabular Classification

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Yifei Yuan, Jiatong Li, Weijia Zhang, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Evangelos Kanoulas, Renjun Hu
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21561v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-08-29 12:16:24
- **Comment**: EMNLP 25 Findings
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on large language models (LLMs) and their application to few-shot tabular classification, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and query understanding. However, the primary focus on LLMs and data-driven insight distillation does not directly align with the user's interests in search technologies, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The paper's relevance is somewhat enhanced by its use of data modeling techniques, but it does not strongly connect to the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

### 14. A Survey on Current Trends and Recent Advances in Text Anonymization

#### Abstract
> The proliferation of textual data containing sensitive personal information
across various domains requires robust anonymization techniques to protect
privacy and comply with regulations, while preserving data usability for
diverse and crucial downstream tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive
overview of current trends and recent advances in text anonymization
techniques. We begin by discussing foundational approaches, primarily centered
on Named Entity Recognition, before examining the transformative impact of
Large Language Models, detailing their dual role as sophisticated anonymizers
and potent de-anonymization threats. The survey further explores
domain-specific challenges and tailored solutions in critical sectors such as
healthcare, law, finance, and education. We investigate advanced methodologies
incorporating formal privacy models and risk-aware frameworks, and address the
specialized subfield of authorship anonymization. Additionally, we review
evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical
toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review
consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent
challenges, including the evolving privacy-utility trade-off, the need to
address quasi-identifiers, and the implications of LLM capabilities, and aims
to guide future research directions for both academics and practitioners in
this field.

- **Submitted**: 2025-08-29 05:25:05
- **Comment**: Accepted to RecSys 2025 (short paper)
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend
- **Reason**: The paper is somewhat relevant to Information Retrieval and Search technologies, as it deals with recommender systems, but it focuses more on fairness and evaluation measures rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. While it touches on a related topic, it doesn't align with the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

#### Abstract
> Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

#### Abstract
> Comprehensive evaluation of the recommendation capabilities of existing
foundation models across diverse datasets and domains is essential for
advancing the development of recommendation foundation models. In this study,
we introduce RecBench-MD, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to
assess the recommendation abilities of foundation models from a zero-resource,
multi-dataset, and multi-domain perspective. Through extensive evaluations of
19 foundation models across 15 datasets spanning 10 diverse domains --
including e-commerce, entertainment, and social media -- we identify key
characteristics of these models in recommendation tasks. Our findings suggest
that in-domain fine-tuning achieves optimal performance, while cross-dataset
transfer learning provides effective practical support for new recommendation
scenarios. Additionally, we observe that multi-domain training significantly
enhances the adaptability of foundation models. All code and data have been
publicly released to facilitate future research.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

While it involves some aspects of knowledge representation and retrieval, the context and application are quite different from the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> Recent advances have enabled the extraction of vectorized features from
digital historical maps. To fully leverage this information, however, the
extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that
supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering
(QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query
languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this
project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge
graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of
the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of
GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map
images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to
provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate
that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high
semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web
application that supports interactive querying and visualization.

#### Abstract
> With the growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an
increasing need for robust evaluation methods, especially in multilingual and
non-English contexts. We present an updated version of the BLUEX dataset, now
including 2024-2025 exams and automatically generated image captions using
state-of-the-art models, enhancing its relevance for data contamination studies
in LLM pretraining. Captioning strategies increase accessibility to text-only
models by more than 40%, producing 1,422 usable questions, more than doubling
the number in the original BLUEX. We evaluated commercial and open-source LLMs
and their ability to leverage visual context through captions.

Although it touches on computational efficiency and model training, the context is specific to news recommendation and does not align with your primary interests.

#### Abstract
> Reproducing and comparing results in news recommendation research has become
increasingly difficult. This is due to a fragmented ecosystem of diverse
codebases, varied configurations, and mainly due to resource-intensive models.
We introduce NewsReX, an open-source library designed to streamline this
process. Our key contribution is a modern implementation built on Keras 3 and
JAX, which provides an increase in computational efficiency. Experiments show
that NewsReX is faster than current implementations. To support broader
research, we provide a straightforward guide and scripts for training models on
custom datasets. We validated this functionality using a proprietary Japanese
news dataset from Nikkei News, a leading Japanese media corporation renowned
for its comprehensive coverage of business, economic, and financial news.
NewsReX makes reproducing complex experiments faster and more accessible to a
wider range of hardware making sure the speed up it also achieved for less
powerful GPUs, like an 8GB RTX 3060 Ti. Beyond the library, this paper offers
an analysis of key training parameters often overlooked in the literature,
including the effect of different negative sampling strategies, the varying
number of epochs, the impact of random batching, and more. This supplementary
analysis serves as a valuable reference for future research, aiming to reduce
redundant computation when comparing baselines and guide best practices. Code

While it touches on aspects of model evaluation and fairness, it does not directly relate to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval (IR), query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

However, it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of your research.

#### Abstract
> Hyperparameter optimization is critical for improving the performance of
recommender systems, yet its implementation is often treated as a neutral or
secondary concern. In this work, we shift focus from model benchmarking to
auditing the behavior of RecBole, a widely used recommendation framework. We
show that RecBole's internal defaults, particularly an undocumented
early-stopping policy, can prematurely terminate Random Search and Bayesian
Optimization. This limits search coverage in ways that are not visible to
users. Using six models and two datasets, we compare search strategies and
quantify both performance variance and search path instability. Our findings
reveal that hidden framework logic can introduce variability comparable to the
differences between search strategies. These results highlight the importance
of treating frameworks as active components of experimental design and call for
more transparent, reproducibility-aware tooling in recommender systems
research. We provide actionable recommendations for researchers and developers
to mitigate hidden configuration behaviors and improve the transparency of
hyperparameter tuning workflows.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on fake news detection and ensemble methods, which is not directly related to your core research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While it involves machine learning and classifier selection, the context and application domain are quite different from your areas of focus.

#### Abstract
> Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

While it involves user behavior modeling, the context is specific to UI agents and accessibility, making it less relevant to your broader interests.

#### Abstract
> User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier
to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents
typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices
or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

- **Reason**: This paper is not directly related to your core research interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. While it involves large language models, the focus is on medical applications and reward models, which is not a primary area of interest for you.

#### Abstract
> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

While it involves data optimization, the context is specific to LLMs and does not align with your interests in query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

#### Abstract
> This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation
models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the
growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language
processing. We conduct systematic experiments comparing five distinct models:
Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum
RWKV (QRWKV), and Quantum Attention Sequence Architecture (QASA) across five
diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases,
haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including
perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency
measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The
experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain
overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest

#### Abstract
> Algorithmic hiring has become increasingly necessary in some sectors as it
promises to deal with hundreds or even thousands of applicants. At the heart of
these systems are algorithms designed to retrieve and rank candidate profiles,
which are usually represented by Curricula Vitae (CVs). Research has shown,
however, that such technologies can inadvertently introduce bias, leading to
discrimination based on factors such as candidates' age, gender, or national
origin. Developing methods to measure, mitigate, and explain bias in
algorithmic hiring, as well as to evaluate and compare fairness techniques
before deployment, requires sets of CVs that reflect the characteristics of
people from diverse backgrounds.
  However, datasets of these characteristics that can be used to conduct this
research do not exist. To address this limitation, this paper introduces an
approach for building a synthetic dataset of CVs with features modeled on real
materials collected through a data donation campaign. Additionally, the
resulting dataset of 1,730 CVs is presented, which we envision as a potential
benchmarking standard for research on algorithmic hiring discrimination.

The topic of data minimization is not directly related to your core research themes in Information Retrieval and Search technologies, particularly query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Although it touches on AI applications, it does not specifically address search technologies or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their
development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key
challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are
addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's
closed source GPT-4o (May 2024 update) and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (March 2025), a
large open source Mixture-of-Experts model. Through this comparison, we
showcase the trade-offs between closed source models (robust safety, fine-tuned
reliability) and open source models (efficiency, adaptability). We also explore
LLM applications across different domains (from chatbots and coding tools to
healthcare and education), highlighting which model attributes are best suited
for each use case. This article aims to guide AI researchers, developers, and
decision-makers in understanding current LLM capabilities, limitations, and
best practices.

- **Topic Keywords**: search
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on self-consistency hallucination detection in large language models, which is not directly related to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While it touches on aspects of model performance, it does not address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, making it only loosely relevant to the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on designing conversational agents for children, which is outside the user's primary research interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. While it involves Natural Language Processing, the context and application are not directly related to the user's areas of focus.

#### Abstract
> This paper presents two studies on how Brazilian children (ages 9--11) use
conversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment, and
how structured scaffolds can enhance these interactions. In Study 1, a
seven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents,
teachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map
children's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others,
functional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform
conversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery,
Entertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support.
In Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges,
comparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an
unstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question
count/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach.
Building on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded
conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and
caregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application
with Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows,
and an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective,
scaffolded learning.

#### Abstract
> Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

### 37. Normality and the Turing Test

- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper is not relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, query understanding, ranking models, user behavior modeling, or Natural Language Processing. The paper's focus on the Turing test, normality, and artificial intelligence is outside your areas of expertise.

#### Abstract
> This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.
