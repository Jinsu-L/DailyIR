Cross-encoders have shown strong effectiveness for reranking\ndue to their deep analysis of query-document pairs. This paper studies the\nimpact of the Lion optimizer, a recent alternative to AdamW, during fine-tuning\nof cross-encoder rerankers. We fine-tune three transformer models-MiniLM, GTE,\nand ModernBERT-on the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset using both optimizers.\nGTE and ModernBERT support extended context lengths (up to 8192 tokens). We\nevaluate effectiveness using TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track and MS MARCO dev set\n(MRR@10). Experiments, run on the Modal cloud platform, reveal that ModernBERT\nwith Lion achieves the best NDCG@10 (0.7225) and MAP (0.5121) on TREC DL 2019,\nwhile MiniLM with Lion ties ModernBERT for MRR@10 (0.5988) on MS MARCO dev.\nLion also provides superior GPU efficiency, improving utilization by 2.67% to\n10.33% across models. We analyze performance trends using standard IR metrics\nand discuss the optimizer's impact on training dynamics across architectures.",

        "title": "Harnessing the Power of Reinforcement Learning for Language-Model-Based Information Retriever via Query-Document Co-Augmentation",
        "abstract": "Recent studies have proposed leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as\ninformation retrievers through query rewriting. However, for challenging\ncorpora, we argue that enhancing queries alone is insufficient for robust\nsemantic matching; the LLM should also have sufficient understanding of the\ncorpus by directly handling and augmenting the documents themselves. To this\nend, we present an LLM-based retriever empowered to augment both user queries\nand corpus documents, with its policy fully explored via reinforcement learning\n(RL) and minimal human inductive bias. Notably, we find that simply allowing\nthe LLM to modify documents yields little benefit unless paired with our\ncarefully designed bidirectional RL framework, which enables the LLM to\nsimultaneously learn and collaborate on both query and document augmentation\npolicies. A key technical challenge in realizing such a framework lies in\njointly updating both policies during training, where the rewards for the two\ndirections depend on each other, making their entangled reward intractable. Our\napproach addresses this by introducing a reward sampling strategy and a\nspecifically designed RL algorithm that enables effective training with these\nsampled rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly enhances LLM-based retrieval performance in both sparse and dense\nsettings, particularly in difficult retrieval domains, and achieves strong\ncross-benchmark generalization.

        "abstract": "Evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems relies on high-quality manual\nrelevance judgments (qrels), which are costly and time-consuming to obtain.\nWhile pooling reduces the annotation effort, it results in only partially\nlabeled datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative to\nreducing reliance on manual judgments, particularly in complex domains like\nmedical case-based retrieval, where relevance assessment requires analyzing\nboth textual and visual information. In this work, we explore using a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to expand relevance judgments, creating\na new dataset of automated judgments. Specifically, we employ Gemini 1.5 Pro on\nthe ImageCLEFmed 2013 case-based retrieval task, simulating human assessment\nthrough an iteratively refined, structured prompting strategy that integrates\nbinary scoring, instruction-based evaluation, and few-shot learning. We\nsystematically experimented with various prompt configurations to maximize\nagreement with human judgments. To evaluate agreement between the MLLM and\nhuman judgments, we use Cohen's Kappa, achieving a substantial agreement score\nof 0.6, comparable to inter-annotator agreement typically observed in\nmultimodal retrieval tasks. Starting from the original 15,028 manual judgments\n(4.72% relevant) across 35 topics, our MLLM-based approach expanded the dataset\nby over 37x to 558,653 judgments, increasing relevant annotations to 5,950. On\naverage, each medical case query received 15,398 new annotations, with\napproximately 99% being non-relevant, reflecting the high sparsity typical in\nthis domain. Our results demonstrate the potential of MLLMs to scale relevance\njudgment collection, offering a promising direction for supporting retrieval\nevaluation in medical and multimodal IR tasks.",

To address these limitations, we propose MarketingFM, a\nretrieval-augmented system that integrates multiple data sources to generate\nkeyword-specific ad copy with minimal human intervention. We validate\nMarketingFM via offline human and automated evaluations and large-scale online\nA/B tests.

        "abstract": "Recommendation systems play a crucial role in our daily lives by impacting\nuser experience across various domains, including e-commerce, job\nadvertisements, entertainment, etc. Given the vital role of such systems in our\nlives, practitioners must ensure they do not produce unfair and imbalanced\nrecommendations. Previous work addressing bias in recommendations overlooked\nbias in certain item categories, potentially leaving some biases unaddressed.\nAdditionally, most previous work on fair re-ranking focused on binary-sensitive\nattributes. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a\nfairness-aware re-ranking approach that helps mitigate bias in different\ncategories of items. This re-ranking approach leverages existing biases to\ncorrect disparities in recommendations across various demographic groups. We\nshow how our approach can mitigate bias on multiple sensitive attributes,\nincluding gender, age, and occupation. We experimented on three real-world\ndatasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our re-ranking scheme in mitigating\nbias in recommendations. Our results show how this approach helps mitigate\nsocial bias with little to no degradation in performance.",

Instead, we employ\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the profile generator with\ntask-specific performance, ensuring that the profiles remain adaptive and\neffective. LettinGo operates in three stages: (1) exploring diverse user\nprofiles via multiple LLMs, (2) evaluating profile quality based on their\nimpact in recommendation systems, and (3) aligning the profile generation\nthrough pairwise preference data derived from task performance. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances recommendation\naccuracy, flexibility, and contextual awareness.

        "abstract": "Verifiers can improve language model capabilities by scoring and ranking\nresponses from generated candidates. Currently, high-quality verifiers are\neither unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean).\nWhile LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose\nverifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle\nverifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we\nintroduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining\nmultiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers,\nwhich typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform\nunweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce\ndependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each\nverifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better\nreflects true response quality. However, directly applying weak supervision\nalgorithms poses challenges, including inconsistent verifier output formats and\nhandling low-quality verifiers. Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics\nto normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers. We study Weaver's\neffectiveness in test-time repeated sampling, where a model generates multiple\ncandidate responses and selects one. Our evaluations show Weaver significantly\nimproves over Pass@1-performance when selecting the first candidate-across\nreasoning and math tasks, achieving o3-mini-level accuracy with Llama 3.3 70B\nInstruct as generator, and an ensemble of 70B or smaller judge and reward\nmodels as verifiers (87.7% average). This gain mirrors the jump between GPT-4o\nand o3-mini (69.0% vs. 86.7%), which required extensive finetuning and\npost-training.

We explore whether LLMs can be made to\nreliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual)\npretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To\nevaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world\ncorpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and\nprobes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks.\nOur approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind\nfacts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit\ncitation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an\nidentifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on\nparaphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which\ncontinually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in\ndiverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and\nfact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from\na cited source and to attribute its own answers.

To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce Cross-modal Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (CAMoE), a\nnovel framework for optimizing click-through rate (CTR) prediction in both\naudio-centric and multi-modal settings. CAMoE enhances traditional\nmixture-of-experts models by incorporating modality-aware task grouping,\nadaptive loss masking, and deep-cross networks (DCN) to capture complex feature\ninteractions within a multi-modal ad ecosystem.

We propose LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Cross-Domain\nSequential Recommendation (LLM-EMF), a novel and advanced approach that\nenhances textual information with Large Language Models (LLM) knowledge and\nsignificantly improves recommendation performance through the fusion of visual\nand textual data. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text\nembeddings, thereby enriching item representations with multimodal data. A\nmultiple attention mechanism jointly learns both single-domain and cross-domain\npreferences, effectively capturing and understanding complex user interests\nacross diverse domains. Evaluations conducted on four e-commerce datasets\ndemonstrate that LLM-EMF consistently outperforms existing methods in modeling\ncross-domain user preferences, thereby highlighting the effectiveness of\nmultimodal data integration and its advantages in enhancing sequential\nrecommendation systems.

        "abstract": "Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded\nscenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum\ngeneration length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length\nincreases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on\n''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic\nlong-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT\ndata, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and\nconsistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support\nthis, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved\nlength control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental\nevaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,\nconsistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,\nachieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and\nArena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and\nQwen3-235B.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and\nOpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex\nreasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).\nHowever, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose\nreasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature\non improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such\nas prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the\npromising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by\nintervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we\npropose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the\nreasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually\ndesigned or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the\nreasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the\nquery by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not\nundermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,\nincluding DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can\neffectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance\nwell. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\\% for the reasoning\nlength on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.",

Previous work has mainly focused on traditional single-list web\nsearch settings; this includes existing surveys that introduced categorizations\nbased on the first generation of probabilistic graphical model (PGM) click\nmodels that have become standard. However, these categorizations have become\noutdated, as their conceptualizations are unable to meaningfully compare PGM\nwith neural network (NN) click models nor generalize to newer interfaces, such\nas carousel interfaces. We argue that this outdated view fails to adequately\nexplain the fundamentals of click model designs, thus hindering the development\nof novel click models.\n  This work reconsiders what should be the fundamental concepts in click model\ndesign, grounding them - unlike previous approaches - in their mathematical\nproperties. We propose three fundamental key-design choices that explain what\nstatistical patterns a click model can capture, and thus indirectly, what user\nbehaviors they can capture. Based on these choices, we create a novel click\nmodel taxonomy that allows a meaningful comparison of all existing click\nmodels; this is the first taxonomy of single-list, grid and carousel click\nmodels that includes PGMs and NNs. Finally, we show how our conceptualization\nprovides a foundation for future click model design by an example derivation of\na novel design for carousel interfaces.",

Our\nsubmission addresses the unique challenges of real-time translation of\nlong-form speech by developing a modular cascade system that adapts strong\npre-trained models to streaming scenarios. We combine Whisper Large-V3-Turbo\nfor ASR with the multilingual NLLB-3.3B model for MT, implementing lightweight\nadaptation techniques rather than training new end-to-end models from scratch.\nOur approach employs document-level adaptation with prefix training to enhance\nthe MT model's ability to handle incomplete inputs, while incorporating\nadaptive emission policies including a wait-$k$ strategy and RALCP for managing\nthe translation stream. Specialized buffer management techniques and\nsegmentation strategies ensure coherent translations across long audio\nsequences. Experimental results on the ACL60/60 dataset demonstrate that our\nsystem achieves a favorable balance between translation quality and latency,\nwith a BLEU score of 31.96 and non-computational-aware StreamLAAL latency of\n2.94 seconds. Our final model achieves a preliminary score on the official test\nset (IWSLT25Instruct) of 29.8 BLEU. Our work demonstrates that carefully\nadapted pre-trained components can create effective simultaneous translation\nsystems for long-form content without requiring extensive in-domain parallel\ndata or specialized end-to-end training.",

Achieving comprehensive\nAI empowerment across multiple disciplines is still out of reach. Present-day\nresearch data collection is often fragmented, lacking unified standards,\ninefficiently managed, and difficult to share. Creating a single platform for\nstandardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of\nbalancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of\nvarious disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully\nenable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly\nmultidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge\nwith sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational\nexpertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas\nplatform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific\ndomains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven\nprogress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy\n(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform\nthat balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data\nacross multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows\nusing customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI\nresearch copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and\nresearch automation.

The key to effective multi-scenario\nrecommendation lies in capturing both user preferences shared across all\nscenarios and scenario-aware preferences specific to each scenario. However,\nexisting methods often overlook user-specific modeling, limiting the generation\nof personalized user representations. To address this, we propose PERSCEN, an\ninnovative approach that incorporates user-specific modeling into\nmulti-scenario matching. PERSCEN constructs a user-specific feature graph based\non user characteristics and employs a lightweight graph neural network to\ncapture higher-order interaction patterns, enabling personalized extraction of\npreferences shared across scenarios. Additionally, we leverage vector\nquantization techniques to distil scenario-aware preferences from users'\nbehavior sequence within individual scenarios, facilitating user-specific and\nscenario-aware preference modeling. To enhance efficient and flexible\ninformation transfer, we introduce a progressive scenario-aware gated linear\nunit that allows fine-grained, low-latency fusion. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PERSCEN outperforms existing methods. Further efficiency\nanalysis confirms that PERSCEN effectively balances performance with\ncomputational cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world industrial\nsystems.",

Notably, the\n\"gibberish\" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt\noptimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM\nalignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is\nnon-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms\nfail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we\npropose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an\nevolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning\nstrategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent\ncomplexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in\nresponse to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines\nunconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens\npresent within the context.

However, they incur high\ninference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward\nor value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a\nmethod named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model\nwithout touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples\ncandidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,\nand (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding\npass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model\ngeneration via a search-based optimization process.

        "abstract": "LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation\n(MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report\npairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these\ndata is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding\nmodel development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address\nthis challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated\nLearning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of\nLLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge\nof communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.\nTo start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication\noverhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently\ndecompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs\nand making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.\nFurthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:\nvarying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse\nreporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further\nenhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,\ncoupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally\ngeneralizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic\naccuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder\nthat harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in\nreporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our\nestablished FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and\nadaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center\ndata and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication\nefficiency.",

        "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into safety-critical\napplications involving sequential decision-making in the real world, it is\nessential to know when to trust LLM decisions. Existing LLM Uncertainty\nQuantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn\nquestion-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios,\ne.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a\nprincipled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential\ndecision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the\ncurrent decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic\nuncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty\nshould be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an\nefficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the\ndirect estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)\nover multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is\nevaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,\nAgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and\nDeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly\noutperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful\naggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp,\nincluding sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate\nuncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness.

In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a\nnovel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the\ntrajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both\nstep-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward\nassignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data.

Empirical results\non challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond\ndemonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs\n(e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines.

To address the\nchallenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of\ngenerating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of\nthe reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct\nanswer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free\nframework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the\nLLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal\nand maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the\nhigh variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and\npropose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable\nreward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four\ngeneral-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR\nconsistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama,\nand Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6\npoints on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong\nverifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points\nacross seven benchmarks.",

        "title": "AdapThink: Adaptive Thinking Preferences for Reasoning Language Model",
        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced\nthe complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated\nself-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a\ncritical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive\ncomputation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex\nones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined\nrules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models'\nevolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive\npost-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while\nmaintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically,\nAdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function\nthat leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically\nadjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting\nto a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that\nbalances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an\nentropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets\nwith DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling\nadaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.",

        "abstract": "Model merging has gained increasing attention due to its intriguing property:\ninterpolating the parameters of different task-specific fine-tuned models leads\nto multi-task abilities. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying\nmechanisms of model merging remain poorly understood. In this work, we delve\ninto the mechanism behind model merging from a representation perspective. Our\nanalysis reveals that model merging achieves multi-task abilities through two\nkey capabilities: i) distinguishing samples from different tasks, and ii)\nadapting to the corresponding expert model for each sample. These two\ncapabilities allow the merged model to retain task-specific expertise, enabling\nefficient multi-task adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose\n\\texttt{SE-Merging}, a self-enhanced model merging framework that leverages\nthese two characteristics to dynamically identify the corresponding task for\neach sample and then adaptively rescales the merging coefficients to further\nenhance task-specific expertise in the merged model.
