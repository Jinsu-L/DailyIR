        "title": "The Promise of Large Language Models in Digital Health: Evidence from Sentiment Analysis in Online Health Communities",
        "abstract": "Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated\nanalysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional\nand medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML\napproaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in\nhealthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these\nchallenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit\nemotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment\nAnalysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior\nperformance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,\nwith no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement\nlevels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern\nrecognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by\nin-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.\nThis approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in\ndigital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for\npatient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health\nstrategies.",

        "abstract": "Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into\nagentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to\nsolve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific\ntasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently\noverlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned\nLLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of\nexecuting harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned\nto execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix\nINjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends\nautomatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding\nthem to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.\nSpecifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)\ngenerating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task\nperformance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING\nsignificantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing\ntheir effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting\napproaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation\ntasks.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as\na key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for\ncomplex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to\nimprove Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced\ngeneration diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically\nrepresents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective\nof training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems\nhelps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,\nwe propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)\nstrategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to\nsynthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain\nidentical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains\npolicy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with\nstandard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains\nof 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and\nAIME25 benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Current News Recommender Systems based on past clicks are designed for\nengagement, but come at the cost of limiting diversity in the suggested\ncontent. While diversity-aware algorithms exist, they suffer from two major\nlimitations. First, they fail to account for normative diversity, which\nrequires fair access to a broad range of perspectives. Second, they typically\napply diversity late in the system's pipeline, after a lot of content has\nalready been filtered out. Both limitations confine their effectiveness and\nprevent them from promoting true normative diversity in news recommendations.\n  We propose Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) to address these\nlimitations. Our framework introduces diversity into the earliest pipeline\nstage and uses a configurable mechanism to align diversity with specific\ndemocratic goals. A2CG represents each news article using multiple aspects of\nperspectives (e.g., sentiment, political leaning, frame) and uses a Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to create a discrete, multi-faceted\nrepresentation. A decoder-only model then learns user preferences over these\naspect codes. We then inject diversity directly by reversing the sign on some\nof the query vector's aspects during the candidate retrieval process, ensuring\na more diverse set of candidates.\n  Our method, evaluated on the MIND dataset, enables a flexible trade-off\nbetween personalization and diversity early in the recommendation pipeline. It\nalso generates more novel, diverse, and serendipitous candidates while\neffectively taking into account aspects that strengthen democratic values.\nThese empirical results make it a promising approach for downstream\ndemocratized news recommendation systems.",

To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images.

        "abstract": "Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant\nadvancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks\nhave been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the\nscientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning\ncapabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key\nchallenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in\nmultilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive\nmodality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge\npoints. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and\nchallenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs\ncover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and\nsupport five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We\nconducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source\nmodels, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for\nexisting MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini\nachieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,\nphysics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly\nhigher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,\nusing MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed\nexisting models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in\nspecific domains.

        "abstract": "We tackle the challenge of integrating large language models (LLMs) with\nexternal recommender systems to enhance domain expertise in conversational\nrecommendation (CRS). Current LLM-based CRS approaches primarily rely on zero-\nor few-shot methods for generating item recommendations based on user queries,\nbut this method faces two significant challenges: (1) without domain-specific\nadaptation, LLMs frequently recommend items not in the target item space,\nresulting in low recommendation accuracy; and (2) LLMs largely rely on dialogue\ncontext for content-based recommendations, neglecting the collaborative\nrelationships among entities or item sequences. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce the CARE (Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders) framework. CARE\ncustomizes LLMs for CRS tasks, and synergizes them with external recommendation\nsystems. CARE (a) integrates external recommender systems as domain experts,\nproducing recommendations through entity-level insights, and (b) enhances those\nrecommendations by leveraging contextual information for more accurate and\nunbiased final recommendations using LLMs. Our results demonstrate that\nincorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information\nsignificantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS by an average\nof 54% and 25% for ReDial and INSPIRED datasets. The most effective strategy in\nthe CARE framework involves LLMs selecting and reranking candidate items that\nexternal recommenders provide based on contextual insights. Our analysis\nindicates that the CARE framework effectively addresses the identified\nchallenges and mitigates the popularity bias in the external recommender.",

        "title": "Improved Generalized Planning with LLMs through Strategy Refinement and Reflection",
        "abstract": "LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing\ngeneralized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the\ntasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of\nthree steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the\ndomain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python\nprogram, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase\nwith a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the\nobserved plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to\nproduce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on\n17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and\nnever deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,\nour best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the\nrespective instance generator.",

        "abstract": "Current e-commerce multimodal retrieval systems face two key limitations:\nthey optimize for specific tasks with fixed modality pairings, and lack\ncomprehensive benchmarks for evaluating unified retrieval approaches. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce\nsearch framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and\ntheir combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a\nflexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive\nfusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations\nwhile handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training\nstrategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),\ncohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and\nadaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated\nmultimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search\nevaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently\noutperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning\nor zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial\nimprovements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image\nretrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to\nlarger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B).

        "abstract": "Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical\nadoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human\nevaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks\nscalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various\nautomatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with\nhuman-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.\nOver time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic\nsimilarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it\nseems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in\nstudies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several\nkey challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,\ntheir effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain\nunstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.\nImportantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of\nmetric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our\nfindings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'.

        "abstract": "Multi-modal recommender system focuses on utilizing rich modal information (\ni.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation\nperformance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the\npowerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these\nmethods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although\ncontrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to\naddress the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main\nlimitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective\nrepresentations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable\ninformation in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the\nhomograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in\nincomplete mining of user-item interplay.\n  To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for\n\\textbf{R}\\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\\textbf{A}l cont\\textbf{R}astive learning\nand ho\\textbf{M}ography relations (\\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement\nmulti-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal\nconstraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and\nretain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine\nhomogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user\ninterest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user\nco-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM\nto various state-of-the-art baselines. Our visualization further shows an\nimprovement made by REARM in distinguishing between modal-shared and\nmodal-unique features.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring\nfactual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to\nalign with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced\nby preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction\nbut can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,\nsycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific\nquestion answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,\ndecision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this\nphenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by\nintroducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of\nsycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much\nuser-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates\nadversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading\nresistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to\nmaintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations\nacross open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic\ntendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that\nfine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with\nchain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while\nreinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA\nbenchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance\nwithout compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a\npractical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.",

This paper examines\ncommon methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are\ncore elements of large language models (LLMs).

Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these\nsemantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain\nthe corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that\nprediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based\ninterpretability.\n  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,\nconcluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic\nupper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word\nembeddings.

During training and testing, we combine\nmeta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also\nfind a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query\nstrategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on\ntraining or testing would seriously degrade the performance.

This high dimensionality requires a\ndifferent evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate\nin a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models\nthat help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the\nusers' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate\nthat the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the\nstructures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act\nsimilarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their\ngroups of preferences to the same degree.",

        "abstract": "Long-term user behavior sequences are a goldmine for businesses to explore\nusers' interests to improve Click-Through Rate. However, it is very challenging\nto accurately capture users' long-term interests from their long-term behavior\nsequences and give quick responses from the online serving systems. To meet\nsuch requirements, existing methods \"inadvertently\" destroy two basic\nrequirements in long-term sequence modeling: R1) make full use of the entire\nsequence to keep the information as much as possible; R2) extract information\nfrom the most relevant behaviors to keep high relevance between learned\ninterests and current target items. The performance of online serving systems\nis significantly affected by incomplete and inaccurate user interest\ninformation obtained by existing methods. To this end, we propose an efficient\ntwo-stage long-term sequence modeling approach, named as EfficieNt Clustering\nbased twO-stage interest moDEling (ENCODE), consisting of offline extraction\nstage and online inference stage. It not only meets the aforementioned two\nbasic requirements but also achieves a desirable balance between online service\nefficiency and precision. Specifically, in the offline extraction stage, ENCODE\nclusters the entire behavior sequence and extracts accurate interests. To\nreduce the overhead of the clustering process, we design a metric\nlearning-based dimension reduction algorithm that preserves the relative\npairwise distances of behaviors in the new feature space. While in the online\ninference stage, ENCODE takes the off-the-shelf user interests to predict the\nassociations with target items. Besides, to further ensure the relevance\nbetween user interests and target items, we adopt the same relevance metric\nthroughout the whole pipeline of ENCODE. The extensive experiment and\ncomparison with SOTA have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our\nproposed ENCODE.",

We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence\nevaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base\ntheir predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to\nmeasure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures\nwhether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted\nprobabilities.

To\naddress this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)\nframework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping\nthem with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before\ndecision-making.

To overcome the lack of suitable training data, we\npropose mining training data by leveraging scholarly references (i.e. signals\nthat capture how research concepts of papers are expressed in different\nsettings), including titles, citation contexts, author-assigned keyphrases, and\nco-citations. CASPER outperforms strong dense and sparse retrieval baselines on\neight scientific retrieval benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate that through\nsimple post-processing, CASPER can be effectively used for the keyphrase\ngeneration tasks, achieving competitive performance with the established\nCopyRNN while producing more diverse keyphrases and being nearly four times\nfaster.",

In this paper, we introduce FLAIR,\na lightweight, feedback learning framework that adapts copilot systems'\nretrieval strategies by integrating domain-specific expert feedback. FLAIR\noperates in two stages: an offline phase obtains indicators from (1) user\nfeedback and (2) questions synthesized from documentation, storing these\nindicators in a decentralized manner. An online phase then employs a two-track\nranking mechanism to combine raw similarity scores with the collected\nindicators. This iterative setup refines retrieval performance for any query.\nExtensive real-world evaluations of FLAIR demonstrate significant performance\ngains on both previously seen and unseen queries, surpassing state-of-the-art\napproaches.

Datarus is trained not on isolated\nquestion-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning\nsteps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,\nall captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,\nnumerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline\ncombines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000\ntagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight\ntag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores\nboth single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a\nmemory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nfeaturing KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.\nA cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to\nsemantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague\nRL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning\ninterface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke\nPython tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On\ndemanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an \"AHA-moment\"\npattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges\navoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.\nAcross standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and\neven reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up\nto 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting\n18-49% fewer tokens per solution.",

        "abstract": "The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the\nperformance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve\nlogical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is\nidiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be\nunderstood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.\nIn this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect\nidiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We\nevaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1\ndistillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four\nidiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller\nand more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but\nnot to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)\nshow modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models\ndemonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate\ndefinitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the\nactual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions\nin the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some\ncases.",

Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on\nRecurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time\ntranscription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a\nsignificant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous\ntranslation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.\nWe also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic\ncues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient\nbeam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to\nmaintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device\nbilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques\noutperform baselines in terms of latency and quality.
