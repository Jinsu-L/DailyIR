#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

- **Rationale**: Existing RAG methods are computationally expensive and struggle to identify the most relevant documents.
- **Ground**: Document Information Gain (DIG) metric quantifies the contribution of each document to LLM answer accuracy.
- **Experiment**: InfoGain-RAG uses a specialized reranker trained with multi-task learning on four benchmark datasets.
- **Takeaway**: InfoGain-RAG significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy while being more efficient.

#### Abstract
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
address key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination,
outdated knowledge, and lacking reference. However, current RAG frameworks
often struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully
contribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter
out irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final
performance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel
metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct
answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference
of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.
Further, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to
train a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from
exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can
effectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones
for better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and
benchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing
approaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on
NaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match
accuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG
respectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary
model GPT-4o across all datasets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of
InfoGain-RAG as it can offer a reliable solution for RAG in multiple
applications.

### 2. LEAF: Knowledge Distillation of Text Embedding Models with Teacher-Aligned Representations

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 12
- **Authors**: Robin Vujanic, Thomas Rueckstiess
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12539v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-16 00:41:05
- **Comment**: 17 pages, 12 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: information retrieval, queries, ranking, retrieval, rank
- **Reason**: This paper presents a knowledge distillation framework for text embedding models, which is relevant to information retrieval and search technologies. The framework's application to information retrieval and its ability to set a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark are particularly noteworthy. However, the focus on text embedding models and knowledge distillation is somewhat tangential to the user's primary interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Text Embedding Models
- **Aim**: Develop a lightweight knowledge distillation method to train smaller, efficient text embedding models while preserving the performance of larger teacher models.
- **Rationale**: Large bi-encoder models in information retrieval (IR) systems are costly and have high latency.
- **Ground**: Existing knowledge distillation methods often require access to internal model structures or contrastive loss functions.
- **Experiment**: The paper introduces LEAF (Lightweight Embedding Alignment Framework) and evaluates its performance on two example models: leaf-ir and leaf-mt, distilled from larger teacher models.
- **Takeaway**: LEAF achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets while offering significant throughput improvements and inheriting desirable properties from teacher models.

#### Abstract
> We present LEAF ("Lightweight Embedding Alignment Framework"), a knowledge
distillation framework for text embedding models. A key distinguishing feature
is that our distilled leaf models are aligned to their teacher. In the context
of information retrieval, this allows for flexible asymmetric architectures
where documents are encoded with the larger teacher model, while queries can be
served with the smaller leaf models. We also show that leaf models
automatically inherit MRL and robustness to output quantization whenever these
properties are present in the teacher model, without explicitly training for
them. To demonstrate the capability of our framework we publish leaf-ir, a 23M
parameters information retrieval oriented text embedding model trained using
LEAF, which sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on BEIR, ranking #1 on the
public leaderboard for this benchmark and for models of its size. When run in
asymmetric mode, its retrieval performance is further increased. Our scheme is
however not restricted to the information retrieval setting, and we demonstrate
its wider applicability by synthesizing the multi-task leaf-mt model. This also
sets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its
size. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding
model training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives,
and training can be conducted using small batch sizes. Thus, dataset and
training infrastructure requirements for our framework are modest. We make our
models publicly available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Xixi Wu, Kuan Li, Yida Zhao, Liwen Zhang, Litu Ou, Huifeng Yin, Zhongwang Zhang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Minhao Cheng, Shuai Wang, Hong Cheng, Jingren Zhou
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13313v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-16 17:57:22
- **Comment**: https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research/
- **Topic Keywords**: queries, rag, search
- **Reason**: The paper explores a novel paradigm for search intelligence, leveraging context summarization to overcome limitations in current search models.

The application to web agents and language models suggests relevance to Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Context limitations in LLM-based web agents
- **Aim**: To develop a novel paradigm for LLM-based web agents that can effectively handle long-horizon search tasks by overcoming the limitations of context window size.
- **Rationale**: Existing methods, like ReAct, struggle with unbounded context growth, especially for complex queries.
- **Ground**: The research introduces ReSum, a paradigm that periodically compresses conversations into structured summaries using a specialized tool called ReSumTool-30B.
- **Experiment**: Experiments on various web agents across three benchmarks (GAIA, BrowseComp-zh, BrowseComp-en) demonstrate that ReSum significantly improves performance compared to ReAct.
- **Takeaway**: ReSum and ReSum-GRPO offer a promising approach to address the context limitations of existing web agents, enabling them to handle complex queries and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

- **Keyword Score**: 8
- **Authors**: Chao Xiong, Xianwen Yu, Wei Xu, Lei Cheng, Chuan Yuan, Linjian Mo
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12948v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-16 10:52:03
- **Topic Keywords**: query, ranking, recommend, rank
- **Reason**: The paper presents a novel architecture for pre-ranking systems, which is related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the focus is on recommender systems rather than traditional search, and the emphasis is on efficiency and scalability rather than deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization. While the paper explores interaction between user and item features, it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Recommender Systems
- **Aim**: To enhance pre-ranking in recommender systems by introducing a novel architecture called FIT (Learnable Fully Interacted Two-tower Model)
- **Rationale**: Traditional two-tower models lack sufficient interaction between user and item features, limiting their performance.
- **Ground**: Existing pre-ranking models such as Two-Tower, DAT, COLD, IntTower, and RankTower.
- **Experiment**: FIT is evaluated on four publicly available datasets (Amazon Electronics, Amazon Books, MovieLens-1M, and Taobao Display Ad Click) using AUC, Logloss, and RelaImpr metrics.
- **Takeaway**: FIT significantly outperforms existing pre-ranking models while remaining computationally efficient. Key findings include performance gains, efficiency improvements, and the importance of both the Meta Query Module (MQM) and Lightweight Similarity Scorer (LSS) components.

#### Abstract
> Pre-ranking plays a crucial role in large-scale recommender systems by
significantly improving the efficiency and scalability within the constraints
of providing high-quality candidate sets in real time. The two-tower model is
widely used in pre-ranking systems due to a good balance between efficiency and
effectiveness with decoupled architecture, which independently processes user
and item inputs before calculating their interaction (e.g. dot product or
similarity measure). However, this independence also leads to the lack of
information interaction between the two towers, resulting in less
effectiveness. In this paper, a novel architecture named learnable Fully
Interacted Two-tower Model (FIT) is proposed, which enables rich information
interactions while ensuring inference efficiency. FIT mainly consists of two
parts: Meta Query Module (MQM) and Lightweight Similarity Scorer (LSS).
Specifically, MQM introduces a learnable item meta matrix to achieve expressive
early interaction between user and item features. Moreover, LSS is designed to
further obtain effective late interaction between the user and item towers.
Finally, experimental results on several public datasets show that our proposed
FIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline pre-ranking models.

### 5. Zero-shot Graph Reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Framework with LLMs

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Hanqing Li, Kiran Sheena Jyothi, Henry Liang, Sharika Mahadevan, Diego Klabjan
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12743v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-16 06:58:58
- **Topic Keywords**: queries, rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper proposes a novel method for graph reasoning using retrieval-augmented generation with large language models, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and NLP. However, the focus on graph reasoning and code generation is not directly aligned with the user's primary interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. While the paper's use of retrieval-augmented generation is relevant, it is not a central match for the user's research themes.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Graph Reasoning
- **Aim**: Develop a training-free and zero-shot method for solving graph reasoning tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach.
- **Rationale**: Existing graph reasoning methods often rely on predefined algorithms or require extensive training data. GRRAF aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of LLMs and a RAG framework.
- **Ground**: The target graph is stored in a graph database (Neo4j).
- **Experiment**: Experiments using GPT-4o as the LLM backbone and Cypher or NetworkX for code generation demonstrate superior performance compared to benchmarks like GraphWiz and GAR.
- **Takeaway**: GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on various graph reasoning tasks, including cycle detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow. Its training-free nature, scalability, and high accuracy make it a promising solution for various graph-based NLP tasks.

#### Abstract
> We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

### 6. Chat-Driven Text Generation and Interaction for Person Retrieval

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Zequn Xie, Chuxin Wang, Sihang Cai, Yeqiang Wang, Shulei Wang, Tao Jin
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12662v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-16 04:40:24
- **Comment**: Accepted by EMNLP 2025. 13 pages, 3 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: queries, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: The paper explores text-based person search and introduces two modules for generating pseudo-labels and refining user queries. While it involves natural language processing and search technologies, it is not directly related to information retrieval, query understanding, or ranking models, which are core areas of your research interests.

#### Abstract
> Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

### 7. Topic Coverage-based Demonstration Retrieval for In-Context Learning

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Wonbin Kweon, SeongKu Kang, Runchu Tian, Pengcheng Jiang, Jiawei Han, Hwanjo Yu
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12451v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-15 21:00:28
- **Comment**: EMNLP 2025 Main
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval, emnlp
- **Reason**: The paper discusses a retrieval framework for in-context learning, which is related to information retrieval and NLP. However, the focus is on demonstration retrieval rather than query understanding or ranking models, making it somewhat relevant but not a central match to the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at

### 8. LLM-as-a-Judge: Rapid Evaluation of Legal Document Recommendation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Anu Pradhan, Alexandra Ortan, Apurv Verma, Madhavan Seshadri
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12382v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-15 19:20:21
- **Comment**: Accepted in EARL 25: The 2nd Workshop on Evaluating and Applying
  Recommender Systems with Large Language Models at RecSys 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval, recommend, rank, search
- **Reason**: The paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and ranking models. However, the focus on legal research and evaluation metrics is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes in IR and search technologies, despite some overlap with NLP and recommender systems.

#### Abstract
> The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

### 9. ConvergeWriter: Data-Driven Bottom-Up Article Construction

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Binquan Ji, Jiaqi Wang, Ruiting Li, Xingchen Han, Yiyang Qi, Shichao Wang, Yifei Lu, Yuantao Han, Feiliang Ren
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12811v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-16 08:30:52
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs), which is somewhat related to your interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. However, the primary focus on text generation and knowledge base retrieval does not directly align with your core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

### 10. MORQA: Benchmarking Evaluation Metrics for Medical Open-Ended Question Answering

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Wen-wai Yim, Asma Ben Abacha, Zixuan Yu, Robert Doerning, Fei Xia, Meliha Yetisgen
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12405v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-15 19:51:57
- **Comment**: 9 pages, 8 tables
- **Topic Keywords**: relevance, search
- **Reason**: The paper is somewhat related to the user's interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and evaluation metrics, but it is not directly focused on information retrieval or query understanding. The medical domain is also not a primary area of interest for the user, although it may share some commonalities with the e-commerce domain.

#### Abstract
> Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

### 11. WebWeaver: Structuring Web-Scale Evidence with Dynamic Outlines for Open-Ended Deep Research

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Zijian Li, Xin Guan, Bo Zhang, Shen Huang, Houquan Zhou, Shaopeng Lai, Ming Yan, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Jun Zhang, Jingren Zhou
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13312v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-16 17:57:21
- **Comment**: An agent system for open-ended deep research
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval, search
- **Reason**: This paper explores the topic of open-ended deep research, which involves synthesizing vast web-scale information into insightful reports. While it touches on information retrieval and retrieval processes, the focus is more on the synthesis and writing aspects, rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest for you. The paper's emphasis on dynamic outlines and iterative methodology is somewhat related to your interests in information retrieval and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

### 12. HistoryBankQA: Multilingual Temporal Question Answering on Historical Events

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Biswadip Mandal, Anant Khandelwal, Manish Gupta
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12720v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-16 06:24:29
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, search
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and temporal reasoning, but it does not directly focus on Information Retrieval (IR) or query understanding. The paper's emphasis on temporal question answering and historical events is not a central match to your primary research themes.

#### Abstract
> Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

### 13. What News Recommendation Research Did (But Mostly Didn't) Teach Us About Building A News Recommender

- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Karl Higley, Robin Burke, Michael D. Ekstrand, Bart P. Knijnenburg
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12361v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-15 18:50:52
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend, personalization, search
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval and recommender systems, but it focuses on news recommendation and does not delve into query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. While it touches on real-world system-building, it is more focused on the challenges and gaps in the news recommendation literature rather than deep semantic understanding or real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> One of the goals of recommender systems research is to provide insights and
methods that can be used by practitioners to build real-world systems that
deliver high-quality recommendations to actual people grounded in their genuine
interests and needs. We report on our experience trying to apply the news
recommendation literature to build POPROX, a live platform for news
recommendation research, and reflect on the extent to which the current state
of research supports system-building efforts. Our experience highlights several
unexpected challenges encountered in building personalization features that are
commonly found in products from news aggregators and publishers, and shows how
those difficulties are connected to surprising gaps in the literature. Finally,
we offer a set of lessons learned from building a live system with a persistent
user base and highlight opportunities to make future news recommendation
research more applicable and impactful in practice.

- **Reason**: This paper explores the phenomenon of over-prompting in Large Language Models, which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on language models and software engineering requirement classification datasets is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes in IR and Search technologies.

#### Abstract
> Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing
objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity.
Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking
a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified
evaluation framework that compares LLM alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO)
across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human
studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead
in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings
provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the
development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.

- **Reason**: This paper introduces a new large language model (LLM) trained from scratch for text embeddings, which shows some relevance to information retrieval and NLP. However, the focus is on text embeddings and LLMs, which, while related to query understanding and ranking models, is not a central match for your research interests.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing
LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding
models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM
trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data
and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on
this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

- **Reason**: The paper explores a novel approach to estimating question difficulty using large language models, which is related to query understanding in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on language models and their internal representations is not directly aligned with the user's primary interests in ranking models and user behavior modeling. The connection to adaptive inference and reasoning strategies is somewhat relevant, but the paper's core contribution is in NLP and LLMs, which is a secondary interest for the user.

#### Abstract
> Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer
generated tokens.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on Multimedia Event Extraction using Large Vision-Language Models, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and NLP. However, it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, making it only loosely relevant to your core research interests.

#### Abstract
> The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

- **Comment**: Preprint
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper explores the application of language models in understanding the market impact of financial news, which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on financial news and market impact is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes, and the paper's emphasis on contextualization and historical context is more relevant to NLP and data mining.

#### Abstract
> Financial news plays a critical role in the information diffusion process in
financial markets and is a known driver of stock prices. However, the
information in each news article is not necessarily self-contained, often
requiring a broader understanding of the historical news coverage for accurate
interpretation. Further, identifying and incorporating the most relevant
contextual information presents significant challenges. In this work, we
explore the value of historical context in the ability of large language models
to understand the market impact of financial news. We find that historical
context provides a consistent and significant improvement in performance across
methods and time horizons. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective
contextualization method that uses a large LM to process the main article,
while a small LM encodes the historical context into concise summary embeddings
that are then aligned with the large model's representation space. We explore
the behavior of the model through multiple qualitative and quantitative
interpretability tests and reveal insights into the value of contextualization.
Finally, we demonstrate that the value of historical context in model
predictions has real-world applications, translating to substantial
improvements in simulated investment performance.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on intent extraction from user interaction trajectories, which is somewhat related to query understanding and user behavior modeling in Information Retrieval. However, the emphasis on smaller models and on-device processing, while interesting, does not directly align with the user's core research themes in IR and NLP.

#### Abstract
> Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

- **Reason**: The paper discusses a methodology for improving information-seeking tasks, specifically by reducing uncertainty in vast information landscapes. While it touches on information retrieval, the focus is more on the development of proprietary agentic systems rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest. The connection to information retrieval is somewhat relevant, but not a central match.

#### Abstract
> Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems, but it focuses more on the cold-start issue in recommender systems and uses techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) such as BPE tokenization and pre-trained Language Models. While it touches on deep semantic understanding, it is not directly related to your primary focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems,
especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new
users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as
conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment
with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation
strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by
applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language
Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained
token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to
using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can
be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate
recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our
mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over
benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings
show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit
Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same
capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more
interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The
practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight,
but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the
zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.

- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, but it focuses on recommender systems and knowledge graph tokenization for next POI recommendation, which is not a central match to your primary focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Generative paradigm, especially powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has
emerged as a new solution to the next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation.
Pioneering studies usually adopt a two-stage pipeline, starting with a
tokenizer converting POIs into discrete identifiers that can be processed by
LLMs, followed by POI behavior prediction tasks to instruction-tune LLM for
next POI recommendation. Despite of remarkable progress, they still face two
limitations: (1) existing tokenizers struggle to encode heterogeneous signals
in the recommendation data, suffering from information loss issue, and (2)
previous instruction-tuning tasks only focus on users' POI visit behavior while
ignore other behavior types, resulting in insufficient understanding of
mobility. To address these limitations, we propose KGTB (Knowledge Graph
Tokenization for Behavior-aware generative next POI recommendation).
Specifically, KGTB organizes the recommendation data in a knowledge graph (KG)
format, of which the structure can seamlessly preserve the heterogeneous
information. Then, a KG-based tokenizer is developed to quantize each node into
an individual structural ID. This process is supervised by the KG's structure,
thus reducing the loss of heterogeneous information. Using generated IDs, KGTB
proposes multi-behavior learning that introduces multiple behavior-specific
prediction tasks for LLM fine-tuning, e.g., POI, category, and region visit
behaviors. Learning on these behavior tasks provides LLMs with comprehensive
insights on the target POI visit behavior. Experiments on four real-world city
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KGTB.

Although it touches on recommender systems, which is a tangential interest, the focus is on the environmental impact of AI-powered personalization, which is not a primary area of focus for the user.

#### Abstract
> As global warming soars, the need to assess and reduce the environmental
impact of recommender systems is becoming increasingly urgent. Despite this,
the recommender systems community hardly understands, addresses, and evaluates
the environmental impact of their work. In this study, we examine the
environmental impact of recommender systems research by reproducing typical
experimental pipelines. Based on our results, we provide guidelines for
researchers and practitioners on how to minimize the environmental footprint of
their work and implement green recommender systems - recommender systems
designed to minimize their energy consumption and carbon footprint. Our
analysis covers 79 papers from the 2013 and 2023 ACM RecSys conferences,
comparing traditional "good old-fashioned AI" models with modern deep learning
models. We designed and reproduced representative experimental pipelines for
both years, measuring energy consumption using a hardware energy meter and
converting it into CO2 equivalents. Our results show that papers utilizing deep
learning models emit approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than papers
using traditional models. On average, a single deep learning-based paper
generates 2,909 kilograms of CO2 equivalents - more than the carbon emissions
of a person flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount of CO2
sequestered by one tree over 260 years. This work underscores the urgent need
for the recommender systems and wider machine learning communities to adopt
green AI principles, balancing algorithmic advancements and environmental
responsibility to build a sustainable future with AI-powered personalization.

While it involves some NLP aspects, the context and application are not directly related to your core themes.

#### Abstract
> We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning
framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown
impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment
on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy
attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA
addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual
tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and
adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through
fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens
while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby
improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires
no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,
making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results
demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token
pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher
success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,
LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%
improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable
query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable
parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that
as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune
tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks
with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant
step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

#### Abstract
> Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully
crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.
Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6
closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately
releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our
code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

#### Abstract
> We present Match Chat, a real-time, agent-driven assistant designed to
enhance the tennis fan experience by delivering instant, accurate responses to
match-related queries. Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key
insights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025
Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million
users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural
language queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented
Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to
pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.
The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response
time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over
96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing
to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal
effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a
frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical
familiarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%
uptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the
scalability and reliability of the platform. This work introduces key design
patterns for real-time, consumer-facing AI systems that emphasize speed,
precision, and usability that highlights a practical path for deploying
performant agentic systems in dynamic environments.

- **Reason**: This paper is not directly related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or Natural Language Processing. While it does involve large language models, the focus is on hallucination detection, which is a specific problem in NLP, and the proposed method is based on signal analysis, not query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

#### Abstract
> Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

#### Abstract
> The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

While it involves natural language processing, the context is specific to audio captioning and does not align with the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by
the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results
achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no
keyword list is used.

### 32. An AI-Powered Framework for Analyzing Collective Idea Evolution in Deliberative Assemblies

- **Reason**: This paper appears to be focused on analyzing collective idea evolution in deliberative assemblies using AI-powered methodologies, which is not directly related to your core research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While it does involve the use of LLMs, the context and application are quite different from your areas of focus.

#### Abstract
> In an era of increasing societal fragmentation, political polarization, and
erosion of public trust in institutions, representative deliberative assemblies
are emerging as a promising democratic forum for developing effective policy
outcomes on complex global issues. Despite theoretical attention, there remains
limited empirical work that systematically traces how specific ideas evolve,
are prioritized, or are discarded during deliberation to form policy
recommendations. Addressing these gaps, this work poses two central questions:
(1) How might we trace the evolution and distillation of ideas into concrete
recommendations within deliberative assemblies? (2) How does the deliberative
process shape delegate perspectives and influence voting dynamics over the
course of the assembly? To address these questions, we develop LLM-based
methodologies for empirically analyzing transcripts from a tech-enhanced
in-person deliberative assembly. The framework identifies and visualizes the
space of expressed suggestions. We also empirically reconstruct each delegate's
evolving perspective throughout the assembly. Our methods contribute novel
empirical insights into deliberative processes and demonstrate how LLMs can
surface high-resolution dynamics otherwise invisible in traditional assembly
outputs.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on video encoding and understanding tasks, which is outside the scope of your primary research interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. While it involves deep learning and NLP, the specific application to video understanding and temporal reasoning does not align with your core themes.

#### Abstract
> Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

While it touches on the topic of model performance, it does not directly relate to information retrieval, query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest. The paper's focus on NLP is relevant, but the specific application and methodology do not align closely with the user's research themes.

#### Abstract
> Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

- **Reason**: This paper is primarily focused on image retrieval and deep hashing models, but it does not align with your core research themes in Information Retrieval, particularly query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The paper's focus on targeted attacks and security risks in image retrieval also does not relate to your interests in real-time relevance optimization and deep semantic understanding.

#### Abstract
> Deep hashing models have been widely adopted to tackle the challenges of
large-scale image retrieval. However, these approaches face serious security
risks due to their vulnerability to adversarial examples. Despite the
increasing exploration of targeted attacks on deep hashing models, existing
approaches still suffer from a lack of multimodal guidance, reliance on
labeling information and dependence on pixel-level operations for attacks. To
address these limitations, we proposed DiffHash, a novel diffusion-based
targeted attack for deep hashing. Unlike traditional pixel-based attacks that
directly modify specific pixels and lack multimodal guidance, our approach
focuses on optimizing the latent representations of images, guided by text
information generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) for the target image.
Furthermore, we designed a multi-space hash alignment network to align the
high-dimension image space and text space to the low-dimension binary hash
space. During reconstruction, we also incorporated text-guided attention
mechanisms to refine adversarial examples, ensuring them aligned with the
target semantics while maintaining visual plausibility. Extensive experiments
have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) targeted
attack methods, achieving better black-box transferability and offering more
excellent stability across datasets.

The paper's focus on text detection and classification does not align closely with the user's primary research themes.

#### Abstract
> LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the
potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as
such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector,
SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in
the out-of-domain setting.

While it involves deep learning models, the context is more aligned with natural language processing and agentic systems, which is somewhat tangential to the user's primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

While it touches on data synthesis and generation, the context is more aligned with knowledge construction and autonomous research systems rather than search or retrieval.

#### Abstract
> Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary
systems.

While it touches on model behavior, it's more aligned with NLP and model interpretability rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

While it involves language models, the application domain and methodology are quite different from your areas of focus.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained
by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine
tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small
language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,
security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various
industries.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on anonymization and privacy preservation in Origin-Destination matrices, which is unrelated to the user's primary research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing.

#### Abstract
> Origin-Destination (OD) matrices are a core component of research on users'
mobility and summarize how individuals move between geographical regions. These
regions should be small enough to be representative of user mobility, without
incurring substantial privacy risks. There are two added values of the
NetMob2025 challenge dataset. Firstly, the data is extensive and contains a lot
of socio-demographic information that can be used to create multiple OD
matrices, based on the segments of the population. Secondly, a participant is
not merely a record in the data, but a statistically weighted proxy for a
segment of the real population. This opens the door to a fundamental shift in
the anonymization paradigm. A population-based view of privacy is central to
our contribution. By adjusting our anonymization framework to account for
representativeness, we are also protecting the inferred identity of the actual
population, rather than survey participants alone. The challenge addressed in
this work is to produce and compare OD matrices that are k-anonymous for survey
participants and for the whole population. We compare several traditional
methods of anonymization to k-anonymity by generalizing geographical areas.
These include generalization over a hierarchy (ATG and OIGH) and the classical
Mondrian. To this established toolkit, we add a novel method, i.e., ODkAnon, a
greedy algorithm aiming at balancing speed and quality. Unlike previous
approaches, which primarily address the privacy aspects of the given datasets,
we aim to contribute to the generation of privacy-preserving OD matrices
enriched with socio-demographic segmentation that achieves k-anonymity on the
actual population.

#### Abstract
> Generative AI powers a growing wave of companion chatbots, yet principles for
fostering genuine connection remain unsettled. We test two routes: visible user
authorship versus covert language-style mimicry. In a preregistered 3x2
experiment (N = 162), we manipulated user-controlled avatar generation (none,
premade, user-generated) and Language Style Matching (LSM) (static vs.
adaptive). Generating an avatar boosted rapport ($\omega^2$ = .040, p = .013),
whereas adaptive LSM underperformed static style on personalization and
satisfaction (d = 0.35, p = .009) and was paradoxically judged less adaptive (t
= 3.07, p = .003, d = 0.48). We term this an Adaptation Paradox: synchrony
erodes connection when perceived as incoherent, destabilizing persona. To
explain, we propose a stability-and-legibility account: visible authorship
fosters natural interaction, while covert mimicry risks incoherence. Our
findings suggest designers should prioritize legible, user-driven
personalization and limit stylistic shifts rather than rely on opaque mimicry.

- **Reason**: This paper is not relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or Natural Language Processing, as it focuses on sitting posture health understanding via pressure sensor data, which is outside your areas of expertise.

#### Abstract
> Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or
pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and
lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that
integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide
instruction comprehension.

The paper focuses on cancer diagnostics and treatment using machine learning and pathway analysis, which is outside your areas of expertise.

#### Abstract
> Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

#### Abstract
> This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

investigated spoken language expressions of participation in collective action,
categorized as problem-solution, call-to-action, intention, and execution. We
identified podcast episodes discussing racial justice after important
BLM-related events in May and June of 2020, and extracted participatory
statements using a layered framework adapted from prior work on social media.
We examined the emotional dimensions of these statements, detecting eight key
emotions and their association with varying stages of activism. We found that
emotional profiles vary by stage, with different positive emotions standing out
during calls-to-action, intention, and execution. We detected negative
associations between collective action and negative emotions, contrary to
theoretical expectations. Our work contributes to a better understanding of how
activism is expressed in spoken digital discourse and how emotional framing may
depend on the format of the discussion.

#### Abstract
> Existing watermarking methods for large language models (LLMs) mainly embed
watermark by adjusting the token sampling prediction or post-processing,
lacking intrinsic coupling with LLMs, which may significantly reduce the
semantic quality of the generated marked texts. Traditional watermarking
methods based on training or fine-tuning may be extendable to LLMs. However,
most of them are limited to the white-box scenario, or very time-consuming due
to the massive parameters of LLMs. In this paper, we present a new watermarking
framework for LLMs, where the watermark is embedded into the LLM by
manipulating the internal parameters of the LLM, and can be extracted from the
generated text without accessing the LLM. Comparing with related methods, the
proposed method entangles the watermark with the intrinsic parameters of the
LLM, which better balances the robustness and imperceptibility of the
watermark. Moreover, the proposed method enables us to extract the watermark
under the black-box scenario, which is computationally efficient for use.
Experimental results have also verified the feasibility, superiority and
practicality. This work provides a new perspective different from mainstream
works, which may shed light on future research.
