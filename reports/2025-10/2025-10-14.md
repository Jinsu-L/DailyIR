#### Abstract
> Neural IR has advanced through two distinct paths: entity-oriented approaches
leveraging knowledge graphs and multi-vector models capturing fine-grained
semantics. We introduce QDER, a neural re-ranking model that unifies these
approaches by integrating knowledge graph semantics into a multi-vector model.
QDER's key innovation lies in its modeling of query-document relationships:
rather than computing similarity scores on aggregated embeddings, we maintain
individual token and entity representations throughout the ranking process,
performing aggregation only at the final scoring stage - an approach we call
"late aggregation." We first transform these fine-grained representations
through learned attention patterns, then apply carefully chosen mathematical
operations for precise matches. Experiments across five standard benchmarks
show that QDER achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of 36%
in nDCG@20 over the strongest baseline on TREC Robust 2004 and similar
improvements on other datasets. QDER particularly excels on difficult queries,
achieving an nDCG@20 of 0.70 where traditional approaches fail completely
(nDCG@20 = 0.0), setting a foundation for future work in entity-aware
retrieval.

### 2. REGENT: Relevance-Guided Attention for Entity-Aware Multi-Vector Neural Re-Ranking

- **LLM Score**: 9
- **Keyword Score**: 12
- **Authors**: Shubham Chatterjee
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11592v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-13 16:31:42
- **Comment**: To be published in: Proceedings of the 2025 Annual International ACM
  SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval in the
  Asia Pacific Region (SIGIR-AP 2025)
- **Topic Keywords**: information retrieval, ranking, relevance, retrieval, rank
- **Reason**: This paper aligns closely with your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in query understanding and ranking models. The introduction of REGENT, a neural re-ranking model that uses entities as a semantic skeleton to guide attention, is highly relevant to your focus on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Current neural re-rankers often struggle with complex information needs and
long, content-rich documents. The fundamental issue is not computational--it is
intelligent content selection: identifying what matters in lengthy,
multi-faceted texts. While humans naturally anchor their understanding around
key entities and concepts, neural models process text within rigid token
windows, treating all interactions as equally important and missing critical
semantic signals. We introduce REGENT, a neural re-ranking model that mimics
human-like understanding by using entities as a "semantic skeleton" to guide
attention. REGENT integrates relevance guidance directly into the attention
mechanism, combining fine-grained lexical matching with high-level semantic
reasoning. This relevance-guided attention enables the model to focus on
conceptually important content while maintaining sensitivity to precise term
matches. REGENT achieves new state-of-the-art performance in three challenging
datasets, providing up to 108% improvement over BM25 and consistently
outperforming strong baselines including ColBERT and RankVicuna. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to successfully integrate entity semantics
directly into neural attention, establishing a new paradigm for entity-aware
information retrieval.

### 3. From Reasoning LLMs to BERT: A Two-Stage Distillation Framework for Search Relevance

- **LLM Score**: 9
- **Keyword Score**: 9
- **Authors**: Runze Xia, Yupeng Ji, Yuxi Zhou, Haodong Liu, Teng Zhang, Piji Li
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11056v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-13 06:46:43
- **Topic Keywords**: query, relevance, commerce, e-commerce, search
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the area of query understanding and ranking models. The proposed two-stage distillation framework for search relevance prediction aligns with your focus on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization. The application of the framework in an e-commerce search system also resonates with your background in the e-commerce domain.

#### Abstract
> Query-service relevance prediction in e-commerce search systems faces strict
latency requirements that prevent the direct application of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage reasoning
distillation framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a powerful
teacher LLM to a lightweight, deployment-friendly student model. In the first
stage, we address the limitations of general-purpose LLMs by constructing a
domain-adapted teacher model. This is achieved through a three-step process:
domain-adaptive pre-training to inject platform knowledge, supervised
fine-tuning to elicit reasoning skills, and preference optimization with a
multi-dimensional reward model to ensure the generation of reliable and
preference-aligned reasoning paths. This teacher can then automatically
annotate massive query-service pairs from search logs with both relevance
labels and reasoning chains. In the second stage, to address the challenges of
architectural heterogeneity in standard distillation, we introduce Contrastive
Reasoning Self-Distillation (CRSD). By modeling the behavior of the same
student model under "standard" and "reasoning-augmented" inputs as a
teacher-student relationship, CRSD enables the lightweight model to internalize
the teacher's complex decision-making mechanisms without needing the explicit
reasoning path at inference. Offline evaluations and online A/B testing in the
Meituan search advertising system demonstrate that our framework achieves
significant improvements across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness
and practical value.

### 4. DyKnow-RAG: Dynamic Knowledge Utilization Reinforcement Framework for Noisy Retrieval-Augmented Generation in E-commerce Search Relevance

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 20
- **Authors**: Tingqiao Xu, Shaowei Yao, Chenhe Dong, Yiming Jin, Zerui Huang, Dan Ou, Haihong Tang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11122v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-13 08:08:59
- **Topic Keywords**: query, queries, ranking, relevance, rag, retrieval, commerce, e-commerce, rank, search
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of e-commerce search relevance. The DyKnow-RAG framework addresses challenges in query-item relevance modeling, leveraging noisy external context and reinforcement learning. While the focus is on e-commerce, the techniques and innovations presented can be applied to broader IR and NLP problems.

#### Abstract
> Accurately modeling query-item relevance drives e-commerce ranking, yet
long-tail, knowledge-heavy, and fast-evolving queries exceed parametric LLM
coverage. External context (reviews, attribute encyclopedias, UGC) can help but
is noisy, and single-pass latency and cost forbid any clean-then-summarize
step. The model must, per query, judge relevance and decide whether to use,
partially use, or ignore the context. DyKnow-RAG is a dynamic noisy-RAG
framework built on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It trains two rollout
groups (no external context vs a single retrieved chunk) and applies
posterior-driven inter-group advantage scaling that adaptively reweights their
contributions by the per-query correctness gap. This teaches when to trust
retrieval versus fall back to parametric knowledge, without process labels,
value networks, or extra inference passes, preserving single-pass, single-chunk
deployment under production latency. Training combines: (1) supervised
initialization with a structured rationale that explicitly records the
context-usage decision; (2) an RL pool prioritized by SFT uncertainty to focus
where context choice is most consequential; and (3) an optional lightweight DPO
warm start to stabilize with-context calibration. Under a unified
retrieval/index and fixed latency budget, DyKnow-RAG outperforms SFT, DPO, and
vanilla GRPO in offline tests, and delivers consistent lifts on GSB, Query
Goodrate, and Item Goodrate in Taobao A/B testing. It is deployed in Taobao's
production relevance system, serving live traffic. To our knowledge, it is
among the first single-pass RAG solutions for e-commerce relevance, turning
noisy external signals into reliable gains without added online complexity.

### 5. Decoupled Multimodal Fusion for User Interest Modeling in Click-Through Rate Prediction

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 13
- **Authors**: Alin Fan, Hanqing Li, Sihan Lu, Jingsong Yuan, Jiandong Zhang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11066v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-13 07:06:26
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, click, ctr, click-through rate, cvr, recommend, commerce, e-commerce
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in query understanding and ranking models. The focus on click-through rate prediction and user interest modeling aligns with your expertise in e-commerce and user behavior modeling. The proposed Decoupled Multimodal Fusion approach also touches on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Modern industrial recommendation systems improve recommendation performance
by integrating multimodal representations from pre-trained models into ID-based
Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction frameworks. However, existing approaches
typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and
multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained
interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper,
we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a
modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between
ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user
interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge
the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side
information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling.
Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that
decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings
before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck
introduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive
multimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned
under the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline
experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
DMF. Moreover, DMF has been deployed on the product recommendation system of
the international e-commerce platform Lazada, achieving relative improvements
of 5.30% in CTCVR and 7.43% in GMV with negligible computational overhead.

### 6. Next Interest Flow: A Generative Pre-training Paradigm for Recommender Systems by Modeling All-domain Movelines

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 12
- **Authors**: Chen Gao, Zixin Zhao, Lv Shao, Tong Liu
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11317v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-13 12:13:17
- **Topic Keywords**: pairwise, click, ctr, click-through rate, recommend, commerce, e-commerce
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of recommender systems and user behavior modeling. The proposed generative pre-training paradigm and the introduction of a novel framework, AMEN, align with your focus on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization. However, the paper's primary focus on recommender systems and its application in the e-commerce domain is not a central match to your broader interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies.

#### Abstract
> Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a cornerstone of modern recommender
systems, has been dominated by discriminative models that react to past user
behavior rather than proactively modeling user intent. Existing generative
paradigms attempt to address this but suffer from critical limitations: Large
Language Model (LLM) based methods create a semantic mismatch by forcing
e-commerce signals into a linguistic space, while ID-based generation is
constrained by item memorization and cold-start issues. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel generative pre-training paradigm. Our model
learns to predict the Next Interest Flow, a dense vector sequence representing
a user's future intent, while simultaneously modeling its internal Interest
Diversity and Interest Evolution Velocity to ensure the representation is both
rich and coherent. However, this two-stage approach introduces a critical
objective mismatch between the generative and discriminative stages. We resolve
this via a bidirectional alignment strategy, which harmonizes the two stages
through cross-stage weight initialization and a dynamic Semantic Alignment
Module for fine-tuning. Additionally, we enhance the underlying discriminative
model with a Temporal Sequential Pairwise (TSP) mechanism to better capture
temporal causality. We present the All-domain Moveline Evolution Network
(AMEN), a unified framework implementing our entire pipeline. Extensive offline
experiments validate AMEN's superiority over strong baselines, and a
large-scale online A/B test demonstrates its significant real-world impact,
delivering substantial improvements in key business metrics.

### 7. Review of Inference-Time Scaling Strategies: Reasoning, Search and RAG

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 12
- **Authors**: Zhichao Wang, Cheng Wan, Dong Nie
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10787v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-12 20:09:07
- **Topic Keywords**: query, rerank, rag, retrieval, rank, search
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization. The focus on inference-time scaling and techniques such as reasoning, search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aligns with your interests in query understanding and ranking models. However, the paper's primary focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications may not be directly related to your e-commerce background.

#### Abstract
> The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up
model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of
high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting
the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses
additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM
performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review
systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of
inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two
comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods.
Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies,
including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding
methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO),
and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized
by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further
detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval
and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.

### 8. LLM-Specific Utility: A New Perspective for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 11
- **Authors**: Hengran Zhang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Jiaming Zhang, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11358v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-13 12:57:45
- **Comment**: 13 pages, 9 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: queries, relevance, rag, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of query understanding and ranking models. The focus on retrieval-augmented generation and LLM-specific utility aligns with your interests in deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization. However, the paper's primary focus on NLP and LLMs is slightly outside your core e-commerce domain expertise.

#### Abstract
> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on
relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,
i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and
comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic
attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from
the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension
ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion
of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple
datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal
for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across
different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the
LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some
human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific
LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for
LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,
we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We
evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while
verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to
assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and
to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.

### 9. Characterizing Web Search in The Age of Generative AI

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11560v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-13 16:04:03
- **Topic Keywords**: query, queries, web search, rank, search
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of emerging search technologies and the impact of Generative AI on web search. The focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling is also relevant, although not directly addressed in this paper. The study's emphasis on evaluation criteria for web search in the age of Generative AI is a valuable contribution to the field.

#### Abstract
> The advent of LLMs has given rise to a new type of web search: Generative
search, where LLMs retrieve web pages related to a query and generate a single,
coherent text as a response. This output modality stands in stark contrast to
traditional web search, where results are returned as a ranked list of
independent web pages. In this paper, we ask: Along what dimensions do
generative search outputs differ from traditional web search? We compare
Google, a traditional web search engine, with four generative search engines
from two providers (Google and OpenAI) across queries from four domains. Our
analysis reveals intriguing differences. Most generative search engines cover a
wider range of sources compared to web search. Generative search engines vary
in the degree to which they rely on internal knowledge contained within the
model parameters v.s. external knowledge retrieved from the web. Generative
search engines surface varying sets of concepts, creating new opportunities for
enhancing search diversity and serendipity. Our results also highlight the need
for revisiting evaluation criteria for web search in the age of Generative AI.

### 10. HoMer: Addressing Heterogeneities by Modeling Sequential and Set-wise Contexts for CTR Prediction

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 9
- **Authors**: Shuwei Chen, Jiajun Cui, Zhengqi Xu, Fan Zhang, Jiangke Fan, Teng Zhang, Xingxing Wang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11100v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-13 07:47:03
- **Comment**: 10 pages, 6 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, click, ctr, click-through rate, recommend
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the area of click models and user behavior modeling. The proposed HoMer model addresses heterogeneities in CTR prediction, which is a key aspect of recommender systems. Although the focus is on recommender systems, the techniques and architectures discussed can be applied to broader IR and NLP problems.

#### Abstract
> Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which models behavior sequence and
non-sequential features (e.g., user/item profiles or cross features) to infer
user interest, underpins industrial recommender systems. However, most methods
face three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i)
Feature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less
granular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features,
thereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity
arises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items,
yet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the
entire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented
integration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's
effectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle
the above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for
modeling sequential and set-wise contexts. First, we align sequence side
features with non-sequential features for accurate sequence modeling and
fine-grained interest representation. Second, we shift the prediction paradigm
from point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly
parallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves
dual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation,
ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model
size. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer
successfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the
AUC metric, and enhances online business metrics like CTR/RPM by 1.99%/2.46%.
Additionally, HoMer saves 27% of GPU resources via preliminary engineering
optimization, further validating its superiority and practicality.

### 11. What Generative Search Engines Like and How to Optimize Web Content Cooperatively

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Yujiang Wu, Shanshan Zhong, Yubin Kim, Chenyan Xiong
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11438v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-13 14:10:26
- **Topic Keywords**: queries, search
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of Generative Search Engines and their optimization. The use of large language models and the introduction of AutoGEO framework aligns with your focus on query understanding and ranking models. However, the paper's primary focus on Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is somewhat tangential to your core research themes, but still clearly related.

#### Abstract
> By employing large language models (LLMs) to retrieve documents and generate
natural language responses, Generative Engines, such as Google AI overview and
ChatGPT, provide significantly enhanced user experiences and have rapidly
become the new form of search. Their rapid adoption also drives the needs of
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), as content providers are eager to gain
more traction from them. In this paper, we introduce AutoGEO, a framework to
automatically learn generative engine preferences when using retrieved contents
for response generation, and rewrite web contents for more such traction.
AutoGEO first prompts frontier LLMs to explain generative engine preferences
and extract meaningful preference rules from these explanations. Then it uses
preference rules as context engineering for AutoGEO$_\text{API}$, a
prompt-based GEO system, and as rule-based rewards to train
AutoGEO$_\text{Mini}$, a cost-effective GEO model. Experiments on the standard
GEO-Bench and two newly constructed benchmarks using real user queries
demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoGEO in enhancing content traction while
preserving search utility. Analyses confirm the learned rules' robustness and
abilities to capture unique preferences in variant domains, and AutoGEO
systems' ability to embed them in content optimization. The code is released at
https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoGEO.

### 12. VeritasFi: An Adaptable, Multi-tiered RAG Framework for Multi-modal Financial Question Answering

- **Submitted**: 2025-10-12 22:45:24
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, rag, retrieval, rank
- **Reason**: This paper presents a novel framework for multi-modal financial question answering, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and addressing challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats and adapting to company-specific requirements. While primarily focused on the financial sector, the work involves query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling, aligning with your interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. However, the specific application domain and focus on financial question answering may not be a central match for your research.

#### Abstract
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is becoming increasingly essential for
Question Answering (QA) in the financial sector, where accurate and
contextually grounded insights from complex public disclosures are crucial.
However, existing financial RAG systems face two significant challenges: (1)
they struggle to process heterogeneous data formats, such as text, tables, and
figures; and (2) they encounter difficulties in balancing general-domain
applicability with company-specific adaptation. To overcome these challenges,
we present VeritasFi, an innovative hybrid RAG framework that incorporates a
multi-modal preprocessing pipeline alongside a cutting-edge two-stage training
strategy for its re-ranking component. VeritasFi enhances financial QA through
three key innovations: (1) A multi-modal preprocessing pipeline that seamlessly
transforms heterogeneous data into a coherent, machine-readable format. (2) A
tripartite hybrid retrieval engine that operates in parallel, combining deep
multi-path retrieval over a semantically indexed document corpus, real-time
data acquisition through tool utilization, and an expert-curated memory bank
for high-frequency questions, ensuring comprehensive scope, accuracy, and
efficiency. (3) A two-stage training strategy for the document re-ranker, which
initially constructs a general, domain-specific model using anonymized data,
followed by rapid fine-tuning on company-specific data for targeted
applications. By integrating our proposed designs, VeritasFi presents a
groundbreaking framework that greatly enhances the adaptability and robustness
of financial RAG systems, providing a scalable solution for both general-domain
and company-specific QA tasks. Code accompanying this work is available at
https://github.com/simplew4y/VeritasFi.git.

### 13. Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures

- **LLM Score**: 7
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Mihir Gupte, Paolo Giusto, Ramesh S
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-12 20:52:43
- **Comment**: Waiting for Conference Response
- **Topic Keywords**: retriever, rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for structured data, specifically tree-based structures, which is somewhat related to your interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. Although it's not directly focused on information retrieval or e-commerce, it does involve leveraging implicit knowledge and linearized structures, which might be of interest to you in the context of deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on
information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting
with structured data like code files, another popular method,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment
the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best
represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,
particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a
novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a
GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each
hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a
knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using
RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the
generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable
across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the
retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that
leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and
scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

### 14. Uncertainty Quantification for Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning

- **LLM Score**: 6
- **Keyword Score**: 10
- **Authors**: Heydar Soudani, Hamed Zamani, Faegheh Hasibi
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11483v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-13 14:55:28
- **Topic Keywords**: retriever, queries, rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper explores uncertainty quantification for retrieval-augmented reasoning, which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in information retrieval. However, the focus is more on the reasoning process rather than user behavior modeling or deep semantic understanding, making it not a central match to your research interests.

#### Abstract
> Retrieval-augmented reasoning (RAR) is a recent evolution of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that employs multiple reasoning steps for
retrieval and generation. While effective for some complex queries, RAR remains
vulnerable to errors and misleading outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
offers methods to estimate the confidence of systems' outputs. These methods,
however, often handle simple queries with no retrieval or single-step
retrieval, without properly handling RAR setup. Accurate estimation of UQ for
RAR requires accounting for all sources of uncertainty, including those arising
from retrieval and generation. In this paper, we account for all these sources
and introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Consistency (R2C)--a novel UQ
method for RAR. The core idea of R2C is to perturb the multi-step reasoning
process by applying various actions to reasoning steps. These perturbations
alter the retriever's input, which shifts its output and consequently modifies
the generator's input at the next step. Through this iterative feedback loop,
the retriever and generator continuously reshape one another's inputs, enabling
us to capture uncertainty arising from both components. Experiments on five
popular RAR systems across diverse QA datasets show that R2C improves AUROC by
over 5% on average compared to the state-of-the-art UQ baselines. Extrinsic
evaluations using R2C as an external signal further confirm its effectiveness
for two downstream tasks: in Abstention, it achieves ~5% gains in both
F1Abstain and AccAbstain; in Model Selection, it improves the exact match by
~7% over single models and ~3% over selection methods.

#### Abstract
> Distance-based unsupervised text classification is a method within text
classification that leverages the semantic similarity between a label and a
text to determine label relevance. This method provides numerous benefits,
including fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed
to zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training
in such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information
retrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text
instance is "similar" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label
is determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art
sentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text
instance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary
classification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon
previous literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and
evaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based
classification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the
semantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,
and label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic
multi-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity
distributions show statistically significant differences across models,
datasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing
label-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific
thresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5
thresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work
by an average of 14%. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong performance
even with limited labeled examples.

- **Topic Keywords**: relevance, rag, recommend
- **Reason**: The paper is somewhat related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, particularly in the context of recommender systems and language bias. However, the focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their application in recommender systems is not a central match to the user's primary research themes, which include query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs), owing to their extensive open-domain knowledge
and semantic reasoning capabilities, have been increasingly integrated into
recommender systems (RS). However, a substantial gap remains between the
pre-training objectives of LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation
tasks. To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed
on specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their
predictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it
induces Language Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens-such
as task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens-while underutilizing core user
interaction tokens that encode user-specific preferences. This bias not only
undermines recommendation accuracy but also raises unfairness concerns.
  To address this issue, we propose Group Distributionally Robust
Optimization-based Tuning (GDRT), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that enforces
consistent model performance across token groups with varying degrees of
relevance to auxiliary tokens. By adaptively upweighting underperforming
groups, typically those weakly correlated with auxiliary tokens, GDRT shifts
the model's attention from superficial auxiliary cues to informative user
interaction tokens, thereby mitigating language bias. Extensive experiments
conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that GDRT effectively mitigates
language bias, yielding substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy
(with an average NDCG@10 gain of 24.29%) and significantly enhancing
recommendation fairness.

- **Submitted**: 2025-10-13 13:47:14
- **Comment**: 14 pages, 7 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, search
- **Reason**: This paper explores the concept of self-knowledge and reliability in language models, which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on language model reliability and self-improvement is not a central match to the user's primary research themes, but it may still be useful for understanding the limitations and potential applications of language models in IR.

#### Abstract
> Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands
the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research
shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in
five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to
fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques
that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL
that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility
boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework
combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and
classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based
rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through
internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens
consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.
In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved
self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic
benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external
supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,
outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially
unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge
awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer
deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence
from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process
to all future models.

- **Reason**: The paper's focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its adaptation to domain-specific settings is somewhat related to your interests in Information Retrieval and query understanding. However, the emphasis on data generation and domain-grounded question-answering is not a central match to your primary focus on ranking models and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and
reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to
enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to
domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data
beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable
and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context
(QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces
these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse
questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with
precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG
adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the
LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features
semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval,
along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust
reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and
evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially
suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and
enterprise knowledge bases.

However, the focus is on the internal workings of LLMs rather than user behavior modeling or search technologies, limiting its relevance to your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?"
yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing
a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task
complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual
question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex
queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,
we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a
controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual
questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex
queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic
misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further
uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive
correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through
mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model
internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict
short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes
factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'
trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly
assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in
more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

- **Topic Keywords**: relevance, rag
- **Reason**: The paper explores a community-driven misinformation governance system, leveraging large language models to improve responsiveness and accuracy. While it touches on information retrieval and relevance optimization, the focus is more on NLP and fact-checking, which is somewhat related to your interests but not a central match.

#### Abstract
> Community Notes, the crowd-sourced misinformation governance system on X
(formerly Twitter), enables users to flag misleading posts, attach contextual
notes, and vote on their helpfulness. However, our analysis of 30.8K
health-related notes reveals significant latency, with a median delay of 17.6
hours before the first note receives a helpfulness status. To improve
responsiveness during real-world misinformation surges, we propose CrowdNotes+,
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
Community Notes for faster and more reliable health misinformation governance.
CrowdNotes+ integrates two complementary modes: (1) evidence-grounded note
augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation, along with a hierarchical
three-step evaluation that progressively assesses relevance, correctness, and
helpfulness. We instantiate the framework through HealthNotes, a benchmark of
1.2K helpfulness-annotated health notes paired with a fine-tuned helpfulness
judge. Experiments on fifteen LLMs reveal an overlooked loophole in current
helpfulness evaluation, where stylistic fluency is mistaken for factual
accuracy, and demonstrate that our hierarchical evaluation and LLM-augmented
generation jointly enhance factual precision and evidence utility. These
results point toward a hybrid human-AI governance model that improves both the
rigor and timeliness of crowd-sourced fact-checking.

However, the focus on financial misinformation detection and fact-checking is not directly aligned with your core research themes. The use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and external fact-checking agents is an interesting aspect, but it is not a central match with your primary focus on information retrieval and deep semantic understanding.

#### Abstract
> Financial markets face growing threats from misinformation that can trigger
billions in losses in minutes. Most existing approaches lack transparency in
their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We
introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking
through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive
three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on
retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to
full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides
evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit
uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the
FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a
10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and
37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.

While it touches on query understanding and relevance optimization, it is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes in IR and search technologies.

#### Abstract
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial approach for
enhancing the responses of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge
sources. Despite the impressive performance in complex question-answering
tasks, RAG still struggles with hallucinations. Attributing RAG-generated
content through in-line citations has demonstrated potential in reducing
hallucinations and facilitating human verification. Existing citation
generation methods primarily rely on either fine-tuning the generator or
employing post-processing approaches for citation matching. However, the former
approach demands substantial annotated data and computational resources, while
the latter often encounters difficulties in managing multiple citations and
frequently produces suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel
framework, called VeriCite, designed to rigorously validate supporting evidence
and enhance answer attribution. Specifically, VeriCite breaks down into a
three-stage generation: 1) The initial answer generation first generates a
response based on all available contexts and has its claims verified through
the NLI model; 2) the supporting evidence selection assesses the utility of
each document and extracts useful supporting evidences; 3) the final answer
refinement integrates the initial response and collected evidences to produce
the final, refined answer.We conduct experiments across five open-source LLMs
and four datasets, demonstrating that VeriCite can significantly improve
citation quality while maintaining the correctness of the answers.

However, the focus on document generation and visual structure is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

However, the specific application to recommendation systems and the use of attention mechanisms in LLMs do not align with the user's primary focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Recent years have witnessed a surge of research on leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for sequential recommendation. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable
potential in inferring users' nuanced preferences through fine-grained semantic
reasoning. However, they also exhibit a notable limitation in effectively
modeling collaborative signals, i.e., behavioral correlations inherent in
users' historical interactions. Our empirical analysis further reveals that the
attention mechanisms in LLMs tend to disproportionately focus on tokens within
the same item, thereby impeding the capture of cross-item correlations.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel hierarchical attention masking
strategy for LLM-based recommendation, termed HatLLM. Specifically, in shallow
layers, HatLLM masks attention between tokens from different items,
facilitating intra-item semantic understanding; in contrast, in deep layers,
HatLLM masks attention within items, thereby compelling the model to capture
cross-item correlations. This progressive, layer-wise approach enables LLMs to
jointly model both token-level and item-level dependencies. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HatLLM achieves
significant performance gains (9.13% on average) over existing LLM-based
methods.

- **Reason**: The paper is somewhat related to the user's interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and evaluation metrics, but it focuses on readability and health communication, which is not a central match for the user's primary focus on information retrieval and query understanding.

#### Abstract
> Text simplification is essential for making public health information
accessible to diverse populations, including those with limited health
literacy. However, commonly used evaluation metrics in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), such as BLEU, FKGL, and SARI, mainly capture surface-level
features and fail to account for human-centered qualities like clarity,
trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability. This limitation
is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication
must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To
address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a
five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures
with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects
of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into
participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical
validation. This work aims to advance the evaluation of health text
simplification beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems that align more
closely with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

The paper's focus on language modeling and attention mechanisms, while relevant to NLP, does not align closely with your primary research themes.

#### Abstract
> The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their
dot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design
principles: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token
interactions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to
each input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus
softmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states
(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of
these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically
deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax
these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid
architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical
analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their
absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical
form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when
preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in
isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard
attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our
understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new
avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.

The paper explores the application of Large Language Models in constructing Knowledge Graphs, which is a relevant topic, but it does not address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for knowledge-intensive tasks and have shown
promise in reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However,
constructing high-quality KGs remains difficult, requiring accurate information
extraction and structured representations that support interpretability and
downstream utility. Existing LLM-based approaches often focus narrowly on
entity and relation extraction, limiting coverage to sentence-level contexts or
relying on predefined schemas. We propose a hierarchical extraction framework
that organizes information at multiple levels, enabling the creation of
semantically rich and well-structured KGs. Using state-of-the-art LLMs, we
extract and construct knowledge graphs and evaluate them comprehensively from
both structural and semantic perspectives. Our results highlight the strengths
and shortcomings of current LLMs in KG construction and identify key challenges
for future work. To advance research in this area, we also release a curated
dataset of LLM-generated KGs derived from research papers on children's mental
well-being. This resource aims to foster more transparent, reliable, and
impactful applications in high-stakes domains such as healthcare.

However, the primary focus on deep research safety and report quality does not directly align with the user's core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing
comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses
significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research
cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures
and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match
accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality
such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may
result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final
report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a
comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain
evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple
metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report
dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce
DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation
spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash,
DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success
rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input
guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out
obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline
and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that
DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware
defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while
systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on knowledge distillation for large-scale language models, which is related to deep semantic understanding and model optimization. However, it does not directly address information retrieval or search technologies, and its relevance to user behavior modeling or recommender systems is limited. The paper's emphasis on NLP and model architecture makes it somewhat relevant to the user's broader interests.

#### Abstract
> Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale
language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ
static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of
student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and
apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer.
To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge
Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to
the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic
modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven
Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation
focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating
computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase.
Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a
counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low
temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high
temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's
complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a
plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of
various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on fake news detection, which is not directly related to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. However, the use of deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization in the proposed framework shares some similarities with the user's interests in query understanding and ranking models. The paper's emphasis on evidence scarcity and evaluation-aware decision-making also touches on aspects of user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,
where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing
approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to
generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose
Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time
fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process
according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a
sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)
Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into
decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)
Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large
language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is
adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates
sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the
accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo
labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge
through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the
evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable
evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.
Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news
for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves
generalization to real-time news. The code and dataset are available:

#### Abstract
> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

#### Abstract
> Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating
which problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how
models play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new
paradigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a
formalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale
dataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare
evaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of
people and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative
queries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These
queries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI
evaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to
quantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to
people in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.
However, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to
game-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more
"jaggedness" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater
difficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning
models show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing
queries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational
meta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.

The focus on Large Reasoning Models and safety guardrails seems to be more relevant to the field of AI safety and security, which is not a central theme in your research background.

#### Abstract
> Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs),
such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak
attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the
models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.
The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and
will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the
jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense,
such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series.
Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be
extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once
hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover
a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template
tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful
guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we
introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based
guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range
from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along
with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve
alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different
benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API
services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that
these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse. Code is

While it involves retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods, the context is specific to mathematical theorem proving and does not align with the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

However, it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, making it less relevant to your core research interests.

#### Abstract
> Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising
results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain
underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based
approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative
pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals
within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through
analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm
that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve
as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a
Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive
experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),
showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive
refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This
suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm
for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of
GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on
its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource
visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining
before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding
capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at

While it involves some form of query-level routing, it's more aligned with model training and optimization rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on adapting large language models to downstream tasks using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, but it does not directly relate to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding, which are the primary areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely used
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for adapting large language
models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. While highly effective in single-task
settings, it struggles to efficiently leverage inter-task knowledge in complex
multi-task learning scenarios, often requiring substantial task-specific data
to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce
MeTA-LoRA, a two-stage optimization framework that significantly improves data
efficiency in multi-task adaptation. In the first stage, task-specific LoRA
adapters are learned using only a few samples from each involved dataset,
enabling rapid adaptation without large-scale supervision. In the second stage,
the shared LoRA adapter is updated by aggregating gradients from multiple tasks
to promote knowledge transfer across tasks, further reducing data usage by
leveraging common patterns. In both multi-task learning and multilingual
learning scenarios, our method matches or surpasses the performance of
traditional full-data LoRA fine-tuning approaches, while using significantly
less task-specific data.

- **Reason**: This paper primarily focuses on recommender systems, specifically addressing cold-start item recommendation and inherited popularity bias. While it touches on data mining and related topics, it does not align with the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval, query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems struggle with making
predictions on unseen, or 'cold', items. Systems designed to address this
challenge are often trained with supervision from warm CF models in order to
leverage collaborative and content information from the available interaction
data. However, since they learn to replicate the behavior of CF methods,
cold-start models may therefore also learn to imitate their predictive biases.
In this paper, we show that cold-start systems can inherit popularity bias, a
common cause of recommender system unfairness arising when CF models overfit to
more popular items, thereby maximizing user-oriented accuracy but neglecting
rarer items. We demonstrate that cold-start recommenders not only mirror the
popularity biases of warm models, but are in fact affected more severely:
because they cannot infer popularity from interaction data, they instead
attempt to estimate it based solely on content features. This leads to
significant over-prediction of certain cold items with similar content to
popular warm items, even if their ground truth popularity is very low. Through
experiments on three multimedia datasets, we analyze the impact of this
behavior on three generative cold-start methods. We then describe a simple
post-processing bias mitigation method that, by using embedding magnitude as a
proxy for predicted popularity, can produce more balanced recommendations with
limited harm to user-oriented cold-start accuracy.

While it involves Natural Language Processing (NLP) and language understanding, the focus is on social deduction games and strategy, which is not a primary area of interest for the user.

#### Abstract
> Social deduction games like Werewolf combine language, reasoning, and
strategy, providing a testbed for studying natural language and social
intelligence. However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play,
yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of
social gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival
time or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To
address these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal
Werewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens,
and 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel
strategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies
as ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as
multiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate
stances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation,
which assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This
framework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning
capabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent
gameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse
performance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in
deception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires
research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on quantization techniques for large language models, which is a topic in NLP. However, it does not relate to the user's primary research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks. However, their extensive memory
requirements, particularly due to KV cache growth during long-text
understanding and generation, present significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Quantization has emerged as a promising
solution to reduce memory consumption while preserving historical information.
We propose XQuant, a training-free and plug-and-play framework that achieves
ultra-low equivalent bit-width KV cache quantization. XQuant introduces two key
innovations: a computationally negligible data-free calibration method and
cross-layer KV cache compression, enabling quantization to sub-1.4 bits.
Extensive experiments on TruthfulQA and LongBench demonstrate that XQuant
outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., KIVI-2bit and AsymKV-1.5bit) by
achieving lower bit-width while maintaining superior performance, establishing
a better trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy.

Although it involves a deep learning model, the context is more aligned with recommender systems and web automation rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> LLM-brained web agents offer powerful capabilities for web automation but
face a critical cost-performance trade-off. The challenge is amplified by web
agents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and
environmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address
this, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an
information-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware
Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a
compressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the
expected operational cost. Experiments on five real-world websites from the
WebVoyager benchmark show that WebRouter reduces operational costs by a
striking 87.8\% compared to a GPT-4o baseline, while incurring only a 3.8\%
accuracy drop.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on optimizing the efficiency of Extreme multilabel classification models using low-precision training and memory optimizations. While it touches on a related topic, it does not align with the user's primary research interests in Information Retrieval, query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

While it involves some form of semantic understanding, it is not directly related to Information Retrieval or Search technologies, which are the primary areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> In biomedical fields, one named entity may consist of a series of
non-adjacent tokens and overlap with other entities. Previous methods recognize
discontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which
face challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide
variety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply
explore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid
tagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our
GapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps
between entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance
discontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an
additional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid
tagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to
comprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span
perspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine
mechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of
each span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes
criss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At
the inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each
entity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all
valid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental
results on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable
advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.

The paper's emphasis on Text2SQL systems and inference-based test-time scaling strategies does not align with the user's primary focus on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization in IR.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL)
systems, enabling non-expert users to query industrial databases using natural
language. While test-time scaling strategies have shown promise in LLM-based
solutions, their effectiveness in real-world applications, especially with the
latest reasoning models, remains uncertain. In this work, we benchmark six
lightweight, industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs,
including two reasoning models, evaluating their performance on the BIRD
Mini-Dev benchmark. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, we also report inference
latency and token consumption, providing insights relevant for practical system
deployment. Our findings reveal that Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot
demonstrations consistently enhance performance for both general-purpose and
reasoning-focused LLMs. However, introducing additional workflow steps yields
mixed results, and base model selection plays a critical role. This work sheds
light on the practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity
when deploying Text2SQL systems.

While it touches on the use of LLMs, the context and application are quite different from the user's areas of focus.

#### Abstract
> Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in
financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live
markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods
and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce
Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates
verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures
within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison
under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a
single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk
styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them
across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and
Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets
demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral
patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making,
whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus
establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving
evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

#### Abstract
> Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model
(LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches
typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which
often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off
course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for
smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we
analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning
and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from
incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan
Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan
exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on
the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them
into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design
in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA
module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that
outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K
tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level
preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo
(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields
more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive
experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method
outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward
RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.

While it involves large language models, the focus is on survey response generation, which is a niche application not central to the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> Many in-silico simulations of human survey responses with large language
models (LLMs) focus on generating closed-ended survey responses, whereas LLMs
are typically trained to generate open-ended text instead. Previous research
has used a diverse range of methods for generating closed-ended survey
responses with LLMs, and a standard practice remains to be identified. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the impact that various Survey Response
Generation Methods have on predicted survey responses. We present the results
of 32 mio. simulated survey responses across 8 Survey Response Generation
Methods, 4 political attitude surveys, and 10 open-weight language models. We
find significant differences between the Survey Response Generation Methods in
both individual-level and subpopulation-level alignment. Our results show that
Restricted Generation Methods perform best overall, and that reasoning output
does not consistently improve alignment. Our work underlines the significant
impact that Survey Response Generation Methods have on simulated survey
responses, and we develop practical recommendations on the application of
Survey Response Generation Methods.

- **Comment**: 5 pages. Submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on multimodal learning and bridging the audio-text modality gap, which is not directly related to your core research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While it involves deep semantic understanding, the context is audio-text rather than text-text or text-query, making it less relevant to your primary focus.

#### Abstract
> Contrastive audio-language pretraining yields powerful joint representations,
yet a persistent audio-text modality gap limits the benefits of coupling
multimodal encoders with large language models (LLMs). We present
Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively
maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is
trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and
implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess
the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on
Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first
application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results.
(1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link
reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows
a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2)
Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline
achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised
captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and
7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is
pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and
diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond
knowledge-retrieval-centric designs. Code will be released upon acceptance

- **Submitted**: 2025-10-13 09:04:28
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper appears to be focused on improving the efficiency of reasoning language models, leveraging model uncertainty and entropy distribution to reduce redundant computation. While it touches on the concept of 'reasoning paths', it doesn't seem to be directly related to query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling in the context of information retrieval, which are core areas of your research interests.

#### Abstract
> With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

#### Abstract
> Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in code
generation tasks across various programming languages. However, their outputs
often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks
when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper
introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security
and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and
verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the
Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments
with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often
fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure
code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input
validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential
of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the
trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.
