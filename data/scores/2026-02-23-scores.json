        "abstract": "Ad ranking systems must simultaneously optimize multiple objectives including click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), revenue, and user experience metrics. However, production systems face critical challenges: score scale inconsistency across traffic segments undermines threshold transferability, and position bias in click logs causes offline-online metric discrepancies. We propose CaliCausalRank, a unified framework that integrates training-time scale calibration, constraint-based multi-objective optimization, and robust counterfactual utility estimation. Our approach treats score calibration as a first-class training objective rather than post-hoc processing, employs Lagrangian relaxation for constraint satisfaction, and utilizes variance-reduced counterfactual estimators for reliable offline evaluation. Experiments on the Criteo and Avazu datasets demonstrate that CaliCausalRank achieves 1.1% relative AUC improvement, 31.6% calibration error reduction, and 3.2% utility gain compared to the best baseline (PairRank) while maintaining consistent performance across different traffic segments.",

        "title": "Diagnosing LLM Reranker Behavior Under Fixed Evidence Pools",
        "abstract": "Standard reranking evaluations study how a reranker orders candidates returned by an upstream retriever. This setup couples ranking behavior with retrieval quality, so differences in output cannot be attributed to the ranking policy alone. We introduce a controlled diagnostic that isolates reranking by using Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools. We limit each pool to exactly eight documents and pass identical inputs to all rankers. Within this setup, BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable reference points for lexical matching and diversity optimization. Across 345 clusters, we find that redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. In contrast, LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets. As a result, LLM rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy. By eliminating retrieval variance, we can attribute these differences directly to the ranking policy. This diagnostic is model-agnostic and applicable to any ranker, including open source systems and proprietary APIs.",

        "abstract": "The strong capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have made them highly effective for zero-shot re-ranking task. Attention-based re-ranking methods, which derive relevance scores directly from attention weights, offer an efficient and interpretable alternative to generation-based re-ranking methods. However, they still face two major limitations. First, attention signals are highly concentrated a small subset of tokens within a few documents, making others indistinguishable. Second, attention often overemphasizes phrases lexically similar to the query, yielding biased rankings that irrelevant documents with mere lexical resemblance are regarded as relevant. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{ReAttn}, a post-hoc re-weighting strategy for attention-based re-ranking methods. It first compute the cross-document IDF weighting to down-weight attention on query-overlapping tokens that frequently appear across the candidate documents, reducing lexical bias and emphasizing distinctive terms. It then employs entropy-based regularization to mitigate over-concentrated attention, encouraging a more balanced distribution across informative tokens. Both adjustments operate directly on existing attention weights without additional training or supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

        "abstract": "With the rise of large language models (LLMs), they have become instrumental in applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Yet evaluating these systems remains bottlenecked by the time and cost of building specialized assessment datasets. We introduce KNIGHT, an LLM-based, knowledge-graph-driven framework for generating multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets from external sources. KNIGHT constructs a topic-specific knowledge graph, a structured and parsimonious summary of entities and relations, that can be reused to generate instructor-controlled difficulty levels, including multi-hop questions, without repeatedly re-feeding the full source text. This knowledge graph acts as a compressed, reusable state, making question generation a cheap read over the graph. We instantiate KNIGHT on Wikipedia/Wikidata while keeping the framework domain- and ontology-agnostic. As a case study, KNIGHT produces six MCQ datasets in History, Biology, and Mathematics. We evaluate quality on five criteria: fluency, unambiguity (single correct answer), topic relevance, option uniqueness, and answerability given the provided sources (as a proxy for hallucination). Results show that KNIGHT enables token- and cost-efficient generation from a reusable graph representation, achieves high quality across these criteria, and yields model rankings aligned with MMLU-style benchmarks, while supporting topic-specific and difficulty-controlled evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks by grounding language generation in external evidence. Despite its success, many existing RAG systems are built based on a ranking-centric, asymmetric dependency paradigm, where the generation quality of the generator is highly dependent on reranking results of the reranker. To overcome this limitation, we reformulate RAG as a cooperative multi-agent decision-making problem and propose Cooperative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CoRAG), a framework in which the reranker and the generator act as peer decision-makers rather than being connected through an asymmetric dependency pipeline. By jointly optimizing their behaviors toward a shared task objective, the reranker and generator are encouraged to cooperate, ensuring that document reranking and generation work in concert to improve the final response. Experimental results demonstrate good generalization and improved generation stability of CoRAG, even when the model is trained on only around 10K PopQA samples.

        "title": "Give Users the Wheel: Towards Promptable Recommendation Paradigm",
        "abstract": "Conventional sequential recommendation models have achieved remarkable success in mining implicit behavioral patterns. However, these architectures remain structurally blind to explicit user intent: they struggle to adapt when a user's immediate goal (e.g., expressed via a natural language prompt) deviates from their historical habits. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the semantic reasoning to interpret such intent, existing integration paradigms force a dilemma: LLM-as-a-recommender paradigm sacrifices the efficiency and collaborative precision of ID-based retrieval, while Reranking methods are inherently bottlenecked by the recall capabilities of the underlying model. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Promptable Sequential Recommendation (DPR), a model-agnostic framework that empowers conventional sequential backbones to natively support Promptable Recommendation, the ability to dynamically steer the retrieval process using natural language without abandoning collaborative signals. DPR modulates the latent user representation directly within the retrieval space. To achieve this, we introduce a Fusion module to align the collaborative and semantic signals, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that disentangles the conflicting gradients from positive and negative steering, and a three-stage training strategy that progressively aligns the semantic space of prompts with the collaborative space. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prompt-guided tasks while maintaining competitive performance in standard sequential recommendation scenarios.",

In such settings, negative sampling plays a critical role in model training by constructing negative items that enable effective preference learning and ranking optimization. However, designing reliable negative sampling strategies remains challenging, as they must simultaneously ensure realness, hardness, and interpretability. To this end, we propose \\textbf{ICPNS (In-Community Popularity Negative Sampling)}, a novel framework that leverages user community structure to identify reliable and informative negative samples. Our approach is grounded in the insight that item exposure is driven by latent user communities. By identifying these communities and utilizing in-community popularity, ICPNS effectively approximates the probability of item exposure. Consequently, items that are popular within a user's community but remain unclicked are identified as more reliable true negatives. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ICPNS yields consistent improvements on graph-based recommenders and competitive performance on MF-based models, outperforming representative negative sampling strategies under a unified evaluation protocol.",

Existing methods use the user's query directly to retrieve personal documents, and such strategies often lead to surface-level personalization. We propose PR2 (Personalized Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning), a reinforcement learning framework that integrates reasoning and retrieval from personal context for personalization. PR2 learns adaptive retrieval-reasoning policies, determining when to retrieve, what evidence to retrieve from user profiles, and how to incorporate it into intermediate reasoning steps. By optimizing multi-turn reasoning trajectories under a personalized reward function, the framework reinforces reasoning paths that better align with user-specific preferences and contextual signals reflected by the reward model. Extensive experiments on the LaMP-QA benchmark using three LLMs show that PR2 consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 8.8%-12% in personalized QA.",

        "title": "AgenticRAGTracer: A Hop-Aware Benchmark for Diagnosing Multi-Step Retrieval Reasoning in Agentic RAG",
        "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of agent-based methods in recent years, Agentic RAG has undoubtedly become an important research direction. Multi-hop reasoning, which requires models to engage in deliberate thinking and multi-step interaction, serves as a critical testbed for assessing such capabilities. However, existing benchmarks typically provide only final questions and answers, while lacking the intermediate hop-level questions that gradually connect atomic questions to the final multi-hop query. This limitation prevents researchers from analyzing at which step an agent fails and restricts more fine-grained evaluation of model capabilities. Moreover, most current benchmarks are manually constructed, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, while also limiting scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticRAGTracer, the first Agentic RAG benchmark that is primarily constructed automatically by large language models and designed to support step-by-step validation. Our benchmark spans multiple domains, contains 1,305 data points, and has no overlap with existing mainstream benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even the best large language models perform poorly on our dataset. For instance, GPT-5 attains merely 22.6\\% EM accuracy on the hardest portion of our dataset. Hop-aware diagnosis reveals that failures are primarily driven by distorted reasoning chains -- either collapsing prematurely or wandering into over-extension. This highlights a critical inability to allocate steps consistent with the task's logical structure, providing a diagnostic dimension missing in traditional evaluations.

        "title": "How Retrieved Context Shapes Internal Representations in RAG",
        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by conditioning generation on retrieved external documents, but the effect of retrieved context is often non-trivial. In realistic retrieval settings, the retrieved document set often contains a mixture of documents that vary in relevance and usefulness. While prior work has largely examined these phenomena through output behavior, little is known about how retrieved context shapes the internal representations that mediate information integration in RAG. In this work, we study RAG through the lens of latent representations. We systematically analyze how different types of retrieved documents affect the hidden states of LLMs, and how these internal representation shifts relate to downstream generation behavior. Across four question-answering datasets and three LLMs, we analyze internal representations under controlled single- and multi-document settings. Our results reveal how context relevancy and layer-wise processing influence internal representations, providing explanations on LLMs output behaviors and insights for RAG system design.",

In this work, we propose \"Pyramid MoA\", a hierarchical Mixture-of-Agents architecture that uses a lightweight Router to dynamically escalate queries only when necessary. By leveraging semantic agreement and confidence calibration among an ensemble of small models, our Router identifies \"hard\" problems with high precision. On the GSM8K benchmark, our system achieves 93.0% accuracy, effectively matching the Oracle baseline (98.0%) while reducing compute costs by 61%. We demonstrate that the system introduces negligible latency overhead (+0.82s) and allows for a tunable trade-off between performance and budget.",

Most existing approaches address these issues in a query-dependent manner, entangling table cleanup with reasoning and thus limiting generalization. We introduce QuIeTT, a query-independent table transformation framework that preprocesses raw tables into a single SQL-ready canonical representation before any test-time queries are observed. QuIeTT performs lossless schema and value normalization, exposes implicit relations, and preserves full provenance via raw table snapshots. By decoupling table transformation from reasoning, QuIeTT enables cleaner, more reliable, and highly efficient querying without modifying downstream models. Experiments on four benchmarks, WikiTQ, HiTab, NQ-Table, and SequentialQA show consistent gains across models and reasoning paradigms, with particularly strong improvements on a challenge set of structurally diverse, unseen questions.",

We introduce large-scale data curation pipelines and new benchmarks, compare modeling strategies, and show that modality fusion within a frozen text Matryoshka model performs best. Although trained only for retrieval, the model generalizes well to other tasks, such as speech intent detection, indicating the learning of general semantic representations.

We introduced PolyFrame, our system for the MWE-2026 AdMIRe2 shared task on multimodal idiom disambiguation, featuring a unified pipeline for both image+text ranking (Subtask A) and text-only caption ranking (Subtask B). All model variants retain frozen CLIP-style vision--language encoders and the multilingual BGE M3 encoder, training only lightweight modules: a logistic regression and LLM-based sentence-type predictor, idiom synonym substitution, distractor-aware scoring, and Borda rank fusion. Starting from a CLIP baseline (26.7% Top-1 on English dev, 6.7% on English test), adding idiom-aware paraphrasing and explicit sentence-type classification increased performance to 60.0% Top-1 on English and 60.0% Top-1 (0.822 NDCG@5) in zero-shot transfer to Portuguese. On the multilingual blind test, our systems achieved average Top-1/NDCG scores of 0.35/0.73 for Subtask A and 0.32/0.71 for Subtask B across 15 languages. Ablation results highlight idiom-aware rewriting as the main contributor to performance, while sentence-type prediction and multimodal fusion enhance robustness. These findings suggest that effective idiom disambiguation is feasible without fine-tuning large multimodal encoders.",

We propose CURE, a framework that advances counterfactual survival modeling via comprehensive multimodal embedding and latent subgroup retrieval. CURE integrates clinical, paraclinical, demographic, and multi-omics information, which are aligned and fused through cross-attention mechanisms. Complex multi-omics signals can be adaptively refined using a mixture-of-experts architecture, emphasizing the most informative omics components. Building upon this representation, CURE implicitly retrieves patient-specific latent subgroups that capture both baseline survival dynamics and treatment-dependent variations. Experimental results on METABRIC and TCGA-LUAD datasets demonstrate that proposed CURE model consistently outperforms strong baselines in survival analysis, evaluated using the Time-dependent Concordance Index ($C^{td}$) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). These findings highlight the potential of CURE to enhance multimodal understanding and serve as a foundation for future treatment recommendation models.

However, they struggle to preserve an author's unique literary style, often producing semantically correct but generic outputs. This limitation stems from the inability of current single-model and static multi-agent systems to perceive and adapt to stylistic variations. To address this, we introduce the Style-Adaptive Multi-Agent System (SAMAS), a novel framework that treats style preservation as a signal processing task. Specifically, our method quantifies literary style into a Stylistic Feature Spectrum (SFS) using the wavelet packet transform. This SFS serves as a control signal to dynamically assemble a tailored workflow of specialized translation agents based on the source text's structural patterns. Extensive experiments on translation benchmarks show that SAMAS achieves competitive semantic accuracy against strong baselines, primarily by leveraging its statistically significant advantage in style fidelity.",

        "abstract": "Hateful content on social media increasingly appears as multimodal memes that combine images and text to convey harmful narratives. In low-resource languages such as Bengali, automated detection remains challenging due to limited annotated data, class imbalance, and pervasive code-mixing. To address these issues, we augment the Bengali Hateful Memes (BHM) dataset with semantically aligned samples from the Multimodal Aggression Dataset in Bengali (MIMOSA), improving both class balance and semantic diversity. We propose the Enhanced Dual Co-attention Framework (xDORA), integrating vision encoders (CLIP, DINOv2) and multilingual text encoders (XGLM, XLM-R) via weighted attention pooling to learn robust cross-modal representations. Building on these embeddings, we develop a FAISS-based k-nearest neighbor classifier for non-parametric inference and introduce RAG-Fused DORA, which incorporates retrieval-driven contextual reasoning. We further evaluate LLaVA under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented prompting settings. Experiments on the extended dataset show that xDORA (CLIP + XLM-R) achieves macro-average F1-scores of 0.78 for hateful meme identification and 0.71 for target entity detection, while RAG-Fused DORA improves performance to 0.79 and 0.74, yielding gains over the DORA baseline. The FAISS-based classifier performs competitively and demonstrates robustness for rare classes through semantic similarity modeling. In contrast, LLaVA exhibits limited effectiveness in few-shot settings, with only modest improvements under retrieval augmentation, highlighting constraints of pretrained vision-language models for code-mixed Bengali content without fine-tuning. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of supervised, retrieval-augmented, and non-parametric multimodal frameworks for addressing linguistic and cultural complexities in low-resource hate speech detection.",

        "title": "Facet-Level Persona Control by Trait-Activated Routing with Contrastive SAE for Role-Playing LLMs",
        "abstract": "Personality control in Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) is commonly achieved via training-free methods that inject persona descriptions and memory through prompts or retrieval-augmented generation, or via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on persona-specific corpora. While SFT can be effective, it requires persona-labeled data and retraining for new roles, limiting flexibility. In contrast, prompt- and RAG-based signals are easy to apply but can be diluted in long dialogues, leading to drifting and sometimes inconsistent persona behavior. To address this, we propose a contrastive Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) framework that learns facet-level personality control vectors aligned with the Big Five 30-facet model. A new 15,000-sample leakage-controlled corpus is constructed to provide balanced supervision for each facet. The learned vectors are integrated into the model's residual space and dynamically selected by a trait-activated routing module, enabling precise and interpretable personality steering. Experiments on Large Language Models (LLMs) show that the proposed method maintains stable character fidelity and output quality across contextualized settings, outperforming Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and prompt-only baselines. The combined SAE+Prompt configuration achieves the best overall performance, confirming that contrastively trained latent vectors can enhance persona control while preserving dialogue coherence.",

The challenge is amplified in low-resource languages where annotated datasets are scarce or nonexistent. We present \\textbf{Yor-Sarc}, the first gold-standard dataset for sarcasm detection in Yorùbá, a tonal Niger-Congo language spoken by over $50$ million people. The dataset comprises 436 instances annotated by three native speakers from diverse dialectal backgrounds using an annotation protocol specifically designed for Yorùbá sarcasm by taking culture into account. This protocol incorporates context-sensitive interpretation and community-informed guidelines and is accompanied by a comprehensive analysis of inter-annotator agreement to support replication in other African languages. Substantial to almost perfect agreement was achieved (Fleiss' $κ= 0.7660$; pairwise Cohen's $κ= 0.6732$--$0.8743$), with $83.3\\%$ unanimous consensus. One annotator pair achieved almost perfect agreement ($κ= 0.8743$; $93.8\\%$ raw agreement), exceeding a number of reported benchmarks for English sarcasm research works. The remaining $16.7\\%$ majority-agreement cases are preserved as soft labels for uncertainty-aware modelling.

Despite the high cost of creating these datasets, existing literature has overlooked copyright protection for LLM agent trajectories. This gap leaves creators vulnerable to data theft and makes it difficult to trace misuse or enforce ownership rights. This paper introduces ActHook, the first watermarking method tailored for agent trajectory datasets. Inspired by hook mechanisms in software engineering, ActHook embeds hook actions that are activated by a secret input key and do not alter the original task outcome. Like software execution, LLM agents operate sequentially, allowing hook actions to be inserted at decision points without disrupting task flow. When the activation key is present, an LLM agent trained on watermarked trajectories can produce these hook actions at a significantly higher rate, enabling reliable black-box detection. Experiments on mathematical reasoning, web searching, and software engineering agents show that ActHook achieves an average detection AUC of 94.3 on Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B while incurring negligible performance degradation.",

        "title": "Contradiction to Consensus: Dual Perspective, Multi Source Retrieval Based Claim Verification with Source Level Disagreement using LLM",
        "abstract": "The spread of misinformation across digital platforms can pose significant societal risks. Claim verification, a.k.a. fact-checking, systems can help identify potential misinformation. However, their efficacy is limited by the knowledge sources that they rely on. Most automated claim verification systems depend on a single knowledge source and utilize the supporting evidence from that source; they ignore the disagreement of their source with others. This limits their knowledge coverage and transparency. To address these limitations, we present a novel system for open-domain claim verification (ODCV) that leverages large language models (LLMs), multi-perspective evidence retrieval, and cross-source disagreement analysis. Our approach introduces a novel retrieval strategy that collects evidence for both the original and the negated forms of a claim, enabling the system to capture supporting and contradicting information from diverse sources: Wikipedia, PubMed, and Google. These evidence sets are filtered, deduplicated, and aggregated across sources to form a unified and enriched knowledge base that better reflects the complexity of real-world information. This aggregated evidence is then used for claim verification using LLMs. We further enhance interpretability by analyzing model confidence scores to quantify and visualize inter-source disagreement. Through extensive evaluation on four benchmark datasets with five LLMs, we show that knowledge aggregation not only improves claim verification but also reveals differences in source-specific reasoning. Our findings underscore the importance of embracing diversity, contradiction, and aggregation in evidence for building reliable and transparent claim verification systems",

        "abstract": "Large-scale online marketplaces and recommender systems serve as critical technological support for e-commerce development. In industrial recommender systems, features play vital roles as they carry information for downstream models. Accurate feature importance estimation is critical because it helps identify the most useful feature subsets from thousands of feature candidates for online services. Such selection enables improved online performance while reducing computational cost. To address feature selection problems in deep learning, trainable gate-based and sensitivity-based methods have been proposed and proven effective in industrial practice. However, through the analysis of real-world cases, we identified three bias issues that cause feature importance estimation to rely on partial model layers, samples, or gradients, ultimately leading to inaccurate importance estimation. We refer to these as layer bias, baseline bias, and approximation bias. To mitigate these issues, we propose FairFS, a fair and accurate feature selection algorithm. FairFS regularizes feature importance estimated across all nonlinear transformation layers to address layer bias. It also introduces a smooth baseline feature close to the classifier decision boundary and adopts an aggregated approximation method to alleviate baseline and approximation biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FairFS effectively mitigates these biases and achieves state-of-the-art feature selection performance.",

        "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems aim to predict a user's future interests by extracting temporal patterns from their behavioral history. Existing approaches typically employ transformer-based architectures to process long sequences of user interactions, capturing preference shifts by modeling temporal relationships between items. However, these methods often overlook the influence of group-level features that capture the collective behavior of similar users. We hypothesize that explicitly modeling temporally evolving group features alongside individual user histories can significantly enhance next-item recommendation. Our approach introduces latent group representations, where each user's affiliation to these groups is modeled through learnable, time-varying membership weights. The membership weights at each timestep are computed by modeling shifts in user preferences through their interaction history, where we incorporate both short-term and long-term user preferences. We extract a set of statistical features that capture the dynamics of user behavior and further refine them through a series of transformations to produce the final drift-aware membership weights. A group-based representation is derived by weighting latent group embeddings with the learned membership scores. This representation is integrated with the user's sequential representation within the transformer block to jointly capture personal and group-level temporal dynamics, producing richer embeddings that lead to more accurate, context-aware recommendations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal recommender systems leverage diverse data sources, such as user interactions, content features, and contextual information, to address challenges like cold-start and data sparsity. However, existing methods often suffer from one or more key limitations: processing different modalities in isolation, requiring complete multimodal data for each interaction during training, or independent learning of user and item representations. These factors contribute to increased complexity and potential misalignment between user and item embeddings. To address these challenges, we propose DReX, a unified multimodal recommendation framework that incrementally refines user and item representations by leveraging interaction-level features from multimodal feedback. Our model employs gated recurrent units to selectively integrate these fine-grained features into global representations. This incremental update mechanism provides three key advantages: (1) simultaneous modeling of both nuanced interaction details and broader preference patterns, (2) eliminates the need for separate user and item feature extraction processes, leading to enhanced alignment in their learned representation, and (3) inherent robustness to varying or missing modalities. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on three real-world datasets containing reviews and ratings as interaction modalities. By considering review text as a modality, our approach automatically generates interpretable keyword profiles for both users and items, which supplement the recommendation process with interpretable preference indicators. Experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated datasets.",

While reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to improve performance in this paradigm, its contributions remain underexplored. To fully understand the role of RL, we conduct a systematic study along three decoupled dimensions: prompt template, reward function, and policy optimization. Our study reveals that: 1) the Fast Thinking template yields greater stability and better performance than the Slow Thinking template used in prior work; 2) the F1-based reward underperforms the EM due to training collapse driven by answer avoidance; this can be mitigated by incorporating action-level penalties, ultimately surpassing EM; 3) REINFORCE outperforms PPO while requiring fewer search actions, whereas GRPO shows the poorest stability among policy optimization methods. Building on these insights, we then introduce Search-R1++, a strong baseline that improves the performance of Search-R1 from 0.403 to 0.442 (Qwen2.5-7B) and 0.289 to 0.331 (Qwen2.5-3B).

        "abstract": "Perceived message effectiveness (PME) by potential intervention end-users is important for selecting and optimizing personalized smoking cessation intervention messages for mobile health (mHealth) platform delivery. This study evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict PME for smoking cessation messages.\n  We evaluated multiple models for predicting PME across three domains: content quality, coping support, and quitting support. The dataset comprised 3010 message ratings (5-point Likert scale) from 301 young adult smokers. We compared (1) supervised learning models trained on labeled data, (2) zero and few-shot LLMs prompted without task-specific fine-tuning, and (3) LLM-based digital twins that incorporate individual characteristics and prior PME histories to generate personalized predictions. Model performance was assessed on three held-out messages per participant using accuracy, Cohen's kappa, and F1.\n  LLM-based digital twins outperformed zero and few-shot LLMs (12 percentage points on average) and supervised baselines (13 percentage points), achieving accuracies of 0.49 (content), 0.45 (coping), and 0.49 (quitting), with directional accuracies of 0.75, 0.66, and 0.70 on a simplified 3-point scale. Digital twin predictions showed greater dispersion across rating categories, indicating improved sensitivity to individual differences.\n  Integrating personal profiles with LLMs captures person-specific differences in PME and outperforms supervised and zero and few-shot approaches. Improved PME prediction may enable more tailored intervention content in mHealth. LLM-based digital twins show potential for supporting personalization of mobile smoking cessation and other health behavior change interventions.",

        "abstract": "Agentic memory systems enable large language model (LLM) agents to maintain state across long interactions, supporting long-horizon reasoning and personalization beyond fixed context windows. Despite rapid architectural development, the empirical foundations of these systems remain fragile: existing benchmarks are often underscaled, evaluation metrics are misaligned with semantic utility, performance varies significantly across backbone models, and system-level costs are frequently overlooked. This survey presents a structured analysis of agentic memory from both architectural and system perspectives. We first introduce a concise taxonomy of MAG systems based on four memory structures. Then, we analyze key pain points limiting current systems, including benchmark saturation effects, metric validity and judge sensitivity, backbone-dependent accuracy, and the latency and throughput overhead introduced by memory maintenance. By connecting the memory structure to empirical limitations, this survey clarifies why current agentic memory systems often underperform their theoretical promise and outlines directions for more reliable evaluation and scalable system design.",

However, in the context of LoRA and its variants, the potential of activation subspaces corresponding to tail eigenvectors remains substantially under-exploited, which may lead to suboptimal fine-tuning performance. In this work, we propose Astra (Activation-Space Tail-Eigenvector Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel PEFT method that leverages the tail eigenvectors of the model output activations-estimated from a small task-specific calibration set-to construct task-adaptive low-rank adapters. By constraining updates to the subspace spanned by these tail eigenvectors, Astra achieves faster convergence and improved downstream performance with a significantly reduced parameter budget. Extensive experiments across natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks demonstrate that Astra consistently outperforms existing PEFT baselines across 16 benchmarks and even surpasses full fine-tuning (FFT) in certain scenarios.",

Across diverse reasoning and diagnostic benchmarks (GSM8K, CRUXEval, MBPP, AIME, CorrectBench, and TruthfulQA) using Llama-3 and Qwen-3 (8B), explicit regulatory structuring substantially improves error diagnosis and yields a threefold increase in successful self-correction. Blinded human evaluations over 580 query pairs show an 84% aggregate preference for trustworthiness and metacognitive self-awareness over standard and Chain-of-Thought baselines.

This phase is frequently overlooked in Data Management Plans included in project proposals, despite its important role in ensuring reproducibility and preventing the need for retroactive reconstruction at the time of publication. Here we present Altar, a lightweight, domain-agnostic framework for structuring experimental data from the onset of a project without imposing rigid data models. Altar is built around the Sacred experiment-tracking model and captures experimental (meta)data and structures them. Parameters, metadata, curves and small files are stored in a flexible NoSQL database, while large raw data are maintained in dedicated storage and linked through unique identifiers, ensuring efficiency and traceability. This integration is composable with exiting workflows, allowing integration with minimial disruption of work habits. We document different pathways to use Altar based on users skillset (PhD students, Post-docs, Principal Investigators, Laboratory administrators, System administrators). While getting started with Altar does not require a specialized infrastructure, the framework can be easily deployed on a server and made publicly accessible when scaling up or preparing data for publication. By addressing the dynamic phase of research, Altar provides a practical bridge between exploratory experimentation and FAIR-aligned data sharing.",

        "title": "ManCAR: Manifold-Constrained Latent Reasoning with Adaptive Test-Time Computation for Sequential Recommendation",
        "abstract": "Sequential recommendation increasingly employs latent multi-step reasoning to enhance test-time computation. Despite empirical gains, existing approaches largely drive intermediate reasoning states via target-dominant objectives without imposing explicit feasibility constraints. This results in latent drift, where reasoning trajectories deviate into implausible regions. We argue that effective recommendation reasoning should instead be viewed as navigation on a collaborative manifold rather than free-form latent refinement. To this end, we propose ManCAR (Manifold-Constrained Adaptive Reasoning), a principled framework that grounds reasoning within the topology of a global interaction graph. ManCAR constructs a local intent prior from the collaborative neighborhood of a user's recent actions, represented as a distribution over the item simplex. During training, the model progressively aligns its latent predictive distribution with this prior, forcing the reasoning trajectory to remain within the valid manifold. At test time, reasoning proceeds adaptively until the predictive distribution stabilizes, avoiding over-refinement. We provide a variational interpretation of ManCAR to theoretically validate its drift-prevention and adaptive test-time stopping mechanisms. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ManCAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 46.88% relative improvement w.r.t. NDCG@10.

First, we develop a Generative Item Response Theory (GIRT) model that enables us to estimate student knowledge from their open-ended responses and predict responses to unseen questions. We train the model in a two-step process, first via Supervised Fine-Tuning and then via preference optimization for knowledge-response alignment. Second, we introduce three question selection algorithms that leverage the generative capabilities of the GIRT model, based on the uncertainty, linguistic diversity, and information of sampled student responses. Third, we conduct experiments on two real-world programming datasets and demonstrate that GENCAT outperforms existing CAT baselines, achieving an AUC improvement of up to 4.32\\% in the key early testing stages.",

        "abstract": "ODRL's six set-based operators -- isA, isPartOf, hasPart, isAnyOf, isAllOf, isNoneOf -- depend on external domain knowledge that the W3C specification leaves unspecified. Without it, every cross-dataspace policy comparison defaults to Unknown. We present a denotational semantics that maps each ODRL constraint to the set of knowledge-base concepts satisfying it. Conflict detection reduces to denotation intersection under a three-valued verdict -- Conflict, Compatible, or Unknown -- that is sound under incomplete knowledge. The framework covers all three ODRL composition modes (and, or, xone) and all three semantic domains arising in practice: taxonomic (class subsumption), mereological (part-whole containment), and nominal (identity). For cross-dataspace interoperability, we define order-preserving alignments between knowledge bases and prove two guarantees: conflicts are preserved across different KB standards, and unmapped concepts degrade gracefully to Unknown -- never to false conflicts. A runtime soundness theorem ensures that design-time verdicts hold for all execution contexts. The encoding stays within the decidable EPR fragment of first-order logic. We validate it with 154 benchmarks across six knowledge base families (GeoNames, ISO 3166, W3C DPV, a GDPR-derived taxonomy, BCP 47, and ISO 639-3) and four structural KBs targeting adversarial edge cases. Both the Vampire theorem prover and the Z3 SMT solver agree on all 154 verdicts. A key finding is that exclusive composition (xone) requires strictly stronger KB axioms than conjunction or disjunction: open-world semantics blocks exclusivity even when positive evidence appears to satisfy exactly one branch.",

SHIELD combines disproportionality analysis with semantic clustering of adverse event (AE) terms applied to MedDRA term embeddings. For each AE, the pipeline computes an information-theoretic disproportionality measure (Information Component) with effect size derived via empirical Bayesian shrinkage. A utility matrix is constructed by weighting semantic term-term similarities by signal magnitude, followed by spectral embedding and clustering to identify groups of related AEs. Resulting clusters are annotated with syndrome-level summary labels using large language models, yielding a coherent, data-driven representation of treatment-associated safety profiles in the form of a network graph and hierarchical tree. We implement the SHIELD framework in the context of a single-arm incidence summary, to compare two treatment arms or for the detection of any treatment effect in a multi-arm trial. We illustrate its ability to recover known safety signals and generate interpretable, cluster-based summaries in a real clinical trial example. This work bridges statistical signal detection with modern natural language processing to enhance safety assessment and causal interpretation in clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Automatic Chord Recognition (ACR) is constrained by the scarcity of aligned chord labels, as well-aligned annotations are costly to acquire. At the same time, open-weight pre-trained models are currently more accessible than their proprietary training data. In this work, we present a two-stage training pipeline that leverages pre-trained models together with unlabeled audio. The proposed method decouples training into two stages. In the first stage, we use a pre-trained BTC model as a teacher to generate pseudo-labels for over 1,000 hours of diverse unlabeled audio and train a student model solely on these pseudo-labels. In the second stage, the student is continually trained on ground-truth labels as they become available, with selective knowledge distillation (KD) from the teacher applied as a regularizer to prevent catastrophic forgetting of the representations learned in the first stage. In our experiments, two models (BTC, 2E1D) were used as students. In stage 1, using only pseudo-labels, the BTC student achieves over 98% of the teacher's performance, while the 2E1D model achieves about 96% across seven standard mir_eval metrics. After a single training run for both students in stage 2, the resulting BTC student model surpasses the traditional supervised learning baseline by 2.5% and the original pre-trained teacher model by 1.55% on average across all metrics. And the resulting 2E1D student model improves from the traditional supervised learning baseline by 3.79% on average and achieves almost the same performance as the teacher. Both cases show the large gains on rare chord qualities.",

        "title": "NILE: Formalizing Natural-Language Descriptions of Formal Languages",
        "abstract": "This paper explores how natural-language descriptions of formal languages can be compared to their formal representations and how semantic differences can be explained. This is motivated from educational scenarios where learners describe a formal language (presented, e.g., by a finite state automaton, regular expression, pushdown automaton, context-free grammar or in set notation) in natural language, and an educational support system has to (1) judge whether the natural-language description accurately describes the formal language, and to (2) provide explanations why descriptions are not accurate.\n  To address this question, we introduce a representation language for formal languages, Nile, which is designed so that Nile expressions can mirror the syntactic structure of natural-language descriptions of formal languages. Nile is sufficiently expressive to cover a broad variety of formal languages, including all regular languages and fragments of context-free languages typically used in educational contexts. Generating Nile expressions that are syntactically close to natural-language descriptions then allows to provide explanations for inaccuracies in the descriptions algorithmically.\n  In experiments on an educational data set, we show that LLMs can translate natural-language descriptions into equivalent, syntactically close Nile expressions with high accuracy - allowing to algorithmically provide explanations for incorrect natural-language descriptions. Our experiments also show that while natural-language descriptions can also be translated into regular expressions (but not context-free grammars), the expressions are often not syntactically close and thus not suitable for providing explanations.",

We present KGHaluBench, a Knowledge Graph-based hallucination benchmark that assesses LLMs across the breadth and depth of their knowledge, providing a fairer and more comprehensive insight into LLM truthfulness. Our framework utilises the KG to dynamically construct challenging, multifaceted questions, whose difficulty is then statistically estimated to address popularity bias. Our automated verification pipeline detects abstentions and verifies the LLM's response at both conceptual and correctness levels to identify different types of hallucinations. We evaluate 25 frontier models, using novel accuracy and hallucination metrics. The results provide a more interpretable insight into the knowledge factors that cause hallucinations across different model sizes.

        "abstract": "Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), which aims to retrieve relevant pages within vast corpora of visually-rich documents, is of significance in current multimodal retrieval applications. The state-of-the-art multi-vector paradigm excels in performance but suffers from prohibitive overhead, a problem that current efficiency methods like pruning and merging address imperfectly, creating a difficult trade-off between compression rate and feature fidelity. To overcome this dilemma, we introduce Prune-then-Merge, a novel two-stage framework that synergizes these complementary approaches. Our method first employs an adaptive pruning stage to filter out low-information patches, creating a refined, high-signal set of embeddings. Subsequently, a hierarchical merging stage compresses this pre-filtered set, effectively summarizing semantic content without the noise-induced feature dilution seen in single-stage methods. Extensive experiments on 29 VDR datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, significantly extending the near-lossless compression range and providing robust performance at high compression ratios.",

        "abstract": "One of the first pre-processing steps for constructing web-scale LLM pretraining datasets involves extracting text from HTML. Despite the immense diversity of web content, existing open-source datasets predominantly apply a single fixed extractor to all webpages. In this work, we investigate whether this practice leads to suboptimal coverage and utilization of Internet data. We first show that while different extractors may lead to similar model performance on standard language understanding tasks, the pages surviving a fixed filtering pipeline can differ substantially. This suggests a simple intervention: by taking a Union over different extractors, we can increase the token yield of DCLM-Baseline by up to 71% while maintaining benchmark performance. We further show that for structured content such as tables and code blocks, extractor choice can significantly impact downstream task performance, with differences of up to 10 percentage points (p.p.) on WikiTQ and 3 p.p. on HumanEval.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge hypergraphs surpass traditional binary knowledge graphs by encapsulating complex $n$-ary atomic facts, providing a more comprehensive paradigm for semantic representation. However, constructing high-quality hypergraphs remains challenging due to the \\textit{scenario gap}: generic extractors struggle to generalize across diverse domains with specific jargon, while existing methods often fail to balance structural skeletons with fine-grained details. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Hyper-KGGen}, a skill-driven framework that reformulates extraction as a dynamic skill-evolving process. First, Hyper-KGGen employs a \\textit{coarse-to-fine} mechanism to systematically decompose documents, ensuring full-dimensional coverage from binary links to complex hyperedges. Crucially, it incorporates an \\textit{adaptive skill acquisition} module that actively distills domain expertise into a Global Skill Library. This is achieved via a stability-based feedback loop, where extraction stability serves as a relative reward signal to induce high-quality skills from unstable traces and missed predictions. Additionally, we present \\textbf{HyperDocRED}, a rigorously annotated benchmark for document-level knowledge hypergraph extraction. Experiments demonstrate that Hyper-KGGen significantly outperforms strong baselines, validating that evolved skills provide substantially richer guidance than static few-shot examples in multi-scenario settings.",

        "abstract": "Time-series diagnostic reasoning is essential for many applications, yet existing solutions face a persistent gap: general reasoning large language models (GRLMs) possess strong reasoning skills but lack the domain-specific knowledge to understand complex time-series patterns. Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.",

        "abstract": "Editing Large language models (LLMs) with real-world, unstructured knowledge is essential for correcting and updating their internal parametric knowledge. In this work, we revisit the fundamental next-token prediction (NTP) as a candidate paradigm for unstructured editing. We identify Context Reliance as a critical failure mode of NTP-based approaches, where knowledge acquired from edited text becomes highly dependent on its preceding context, leading to recall failures when that context is absent during inference. This hypothesis is supported by our empirical validation that prepending context during inference recovers knowledge recall. We further theoretically demonstrate that Context Reliance is an inherent consequence of gradient-based optimization, which tends to bind acquired knowledge to a specific aggregated contextual representation. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective COntext-INdependent editing framework (COIN), encouraging model to focus on knowledge within local scope rather than memorizing contextual patterns. Evaluations show that COIN reduces Context Reliance by 45.2% and outperforms strong baselines by 23.6% in editing success rate, highlighting the vital role of mitigating Context Reliance for robust editing.",
