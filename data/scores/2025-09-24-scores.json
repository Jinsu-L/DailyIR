        "title": "The Ranking Blind Spot: Decision Hijacking in LLM-based Text Ranking",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in\ninformation retrieval tasks like passage ranking. Our research examines how\ninstruction-following capabilities in LLMs interact with multi-document\ncomparison tasks, identifying what we term the \"Ranking Blind Spot\", a\ncharacteristic of LLM decision processes during comparative evaluation. We\nanalyze how this ranking blind spot affects LLM evaluation systems through two\napproaches: Decision Objective Hijacking, which alters the evaluation goal in\npairwise ranking systems, and Decision Criteria Hijacking, which modifies\nrelevance standards across ranking schemes. These approaches demonstrate how\ncontent providers could potentially influence LLM-based ranking systems to\naffect document positioning. These attacks aim to force the LLM ranker to\nprefer a specific passage and rank it at the top. Malicious content providers\ncan exploit this weakness, which helps them gain additional exposure by\nattacking the ranker. In our experiment, We empirically show that the proposed\nattacks are effective in various LLMs and can be generalized to multiple\nranking schemes. We apply these attack to realistic examples to show their\neffectiveness. We also found stronger LLMs are more vulnerable to these\nattacks.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced conversational\nArtificial Intelligence(AI) chatbots; however, domain-specific accuracy and the\navoidance of factual inconsistencies remain pressing challenges, particularly\nfor large datasets. Designing an effective chatbot with appropriate methods and\nevaluating its effectiveness is among the challenges in this domain. This study\npresents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that harnesses a\nknowledge graph and vector search retrieval to deliver precise, context-rich\nresponses in an exemplary use case from over high-volume engineering\nproject-related emails, thereby minimising the need for document chunking. A\ncentral innovation of this work is the introduction of RAG Evaluation\n(RAG-Eval), a novel chain-of-thought LLM-based tripartite evaluation framework\nspecifically developed to assess RAG applications. This framework operates in\nparallel with the chatbot, jointly assessing the user's query, the retrieved\ndocument, and the generated response, enabling a holistic evaluation across\nmultiple quality metrics like query relevance, factual accuracy, coverage,\ncoherence and fluency. The resulting scoring system is provided directly to\nusers as a confidence score (1 to 100%), enabling quick identification of\npossible misaligned or incomplete answers. This proposed approach promotes\ntransparency and rapid verification by incorporating metadata email IDs,\ntimestamps into responses. Experimental comparisons against BERTScore and\nG-EVAL for summarisation evaluation tasks confirm its effectiveness, and\nempirical analysis also shows RAG-Eval reliably detects factual gaps and query\nmismatches, thereby fostering trust in high demand, data centric environments.\nThese findings highlight a scalable path for developing accurate,\nuser-verifiable chatbots that bridge the gap between high-level conversational\nfluency and factual accuracy.",

        "title": "Robust Denoising Neural Reranker for Recommender Systems",
        "abstract": "For multi-stage recommenders in industry, a user request would first trigger\na simple and efficient retriever module that selects and ranks a list of\nrelevant items, then calls a slower but more sophisticated deep reranking model\nthat refines the item arrangement before exposure to the user. The latter model\ntypically reranks the item list conditioned on the user's history content and\nthe initial ranking from retrievers. Although this two-stage retrieval-ranking\nframework demonstrates practical effectiveness, the significance of retriever\nscores from the previous stage has been limitedly explored, which is\ninformative. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the limitations of\nusing retriever scores as the rerankers' input directly and argue that the\nreranking task is essentially a noise reduction problem from the retriever\nscores. Following this notion, we derive an adversarial framework, DNR, that\nassociates the denoising reranker with a carefully designed noise generation\nmodule. We extend the conventional score error minimization term with three\naugmented objectives, including: 1) a denoising objective that aims to denoise\nthe noisy retriever scores to align with the user feedback; 2) an adversarial\nretriever score generation objective that improves the exploration in the\nretriever score space; and 3) a distribution regularization term that aims to\nalign the distribution of generated noisy retriever scores with the real ones.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, together with\nanalytical support, validating the effectiveness of the proposed DNR.",

Our experiments cover six high-resource and one low-resource\nlanguage pairs, five model sizes (3B-72B), and various TTS compute budget (N up\nto 1024). Our results show that a) For high-resource languages, TTS generally\nimproves translation quality according to multiple neural MT evaluation\nmetrics, and our human evaluation confirms these gains; b) Augmenting smaller\nmodels with large $N$ can match or surpass larger models at $N{=}1$ with more\ncompute cost; c) Under fixed compute budgets, larger models are typically more\nefficient, and TTS can degrade quality due to metric blind spots in\nlow-resource cases.",

We introduce\nBloomIntent, a user-centric search evaluation method that uses user intents as\nthe evaluation unit.

Then, BloomIntent provides an automated\nevaluation of search results against each intent powered by large language\nmodels. To support practical analysis, BloomIntent clusters semantically\nsimilar intents and summarizes evaluation outcomes in a structured interface.\nWith three technical evaluations, we showed that BloomIntent generated\nfine-grained, evaluable, and realistic intents and produced scalable\nassessments of intent-level satisfaction that achieved 72% agreement with\nexpert evaluators. In a case study (N=4), we showed that BloomIntent supported\nsearch specialists in identifying intents for ambiguous queries, uncovering\nunderserved user needs, and discovering actionable insights for improving\nsearch experiences.

Knowledge graphs (KGs), such as\nthe Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), offer structured biomedical\nknowledge that can support trustworthy reasoning. Prior approaches typically\nintegrate KGs via retrieval augmented generation or fine tuning, inserting KG\ncontent into prompts rather than enabling structured reasoning. We explore an\nalternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths,\nwhere the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct\ndiagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work\nthat leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and\ngrounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is\noften easier than generating one from scratch. It also parallels physicians'\ndiagnostic assessment, where they judge which sequences of findings and\nintermediate conditions most plausibly support a diagnosis. We first\nsystematically evaluate five task formulation for knowledge path judging and\neight training paradigm. Second, we test whether the path judging abilities\ngeneralize to downstream diagnostic tasks, including diagnosis summarization\nand medical question answering. Experiments with three open source\ninstruct-tuned LLMs reveal both promise and brittleness: while specific reward\noptimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, the\ntransferability to downstream tasks remain weak. Our finding provides the first\nsystematic assessment of \"reward model style\" reasoning over clinical KGs,\noffering insights into how structured, reward-based supervision influences\ndiagnostic reasoning in GenAI systems for healthcare.",

In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled\nevaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the\nstrengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based\napplications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing\nprompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation,\nweb-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting\nhomophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both\nshort- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM\nsizes and reasoning capabilities.

        "abstract": "Dynamic Text-Attribute Graphs (DyTAGs), characterized by time-evolving graph\ninteractions and associated text attributes, are prevalent in real-world\napplications. Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing\nmethods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global\ntemporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts\nand the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying\nLLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic\nProcessing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to\nefficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a\nnode-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism\nto efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture\nglobal semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored\nprompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly,\nwe intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as\nthe dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers.\nExtensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority,\nachieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task.\nBesides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs\nand LLMs.",

In this work, we\nintroduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical\ndeployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it\ninto segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice\nyields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales\nlinearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short\nsequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and\nreusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across\ndifferent queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at\nhigh context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x\nand reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance\ncomparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses\nit on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical\nutility.",

To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive\nDecoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that\ndynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe\noperates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights\ntokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised\nimages, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates\nscene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according\nto the predicted safety verdict.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable creative abilities in\ngenerating literary texts, including poetry and short stories. However, prior\nresearch has primarily centered on English, with limited exploration of\nnon-English literary traditions and without standardized methods for assessing\ncreativity. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to generate Persian\nliterary text enriched with culturally relevant expressions. We build a dataset\nof user-generated Persian literary spanning 20 diverse topics and assess model\noutputs along four creativity dimensions-originality, fluency, flexibility, and\nelaboration-by adapting the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. To reduce\nevaluation costs, we adopt an LLM as a judge for automated scoring and validate\nits reliability against human judgments using intraclass correlation\ncoefficients, observing strong agreement. In addition, we analyze the models'\nability to understand and employ four core literary devices: simile, metaphor,\nhyperbole, and antithesis. Our results highlight both the strengths and\nlimitations of LLMs in Persian literary text generation, underscoring the need\nfor further refinement.",

        "abstract": "Social norms govern culturally appropriate behavior in communication,\nenabling dialogue systems to produce responses that are not only coherent but\nalso socially acceptable. We present NormGenesis, a multicultural framework for\ngenerating and annotating socially grounded dialogues across English, Chinese,\nand Korean. To model the dynamics of social interaction beyond static norm\nclassification, we propose a novel dialogue type, Violation-to-Resolution\n(V2R), which models the progression of conversations following norm violations\nthrough recognition and socially appropriate repair. To improve pragmatic\nconsistency in underrepresented languages, we implement an exemplar-based\niterative refinement early in the dialogue synthesis process. This design\nintroduces alignment with linguistic, emotional, and sociocultural expectations\nbefore full dialogue generation begins. Using this framework, we construct a\ndataset of 10,800 multi-turn dialogues annotated at the turn level for norm\nadherence, speaker intent, and emotional response. Human and LLM-based\nevaluations demonstrate that NormGenesis significantly outperforms existing\ndatasets in refinement quality, dialogue naturalness, and generalization\nperformance. We show that models trained on our V2R-augmented data exhibit\nimproved pragmatic competence in ethically sensitive contexts. Our work\nestablishes a new benchmark for culturally adaptive dialogue modeling and\nprovides a scalable methodology for norm-aware generation across linguistically\nand culturally diverse languages.",

This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense\nreasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities\ncoexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded\ncommonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate\nlightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and\ndemonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised\nfine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12\nculture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by\n10\\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that\nout-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or\nsurpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural\ncommonsense transferability beyond the Arab world.

        "title": "Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data",
        "abstract": "The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational\nresources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains\nconventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling\nbehavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In\naddition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries\nof LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.",

        "abstract": "Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with\nsupervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes\nsingle tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts\nor one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning\nerror diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a\nfailure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured\nreflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,\ncontrollable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise\nreflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and\nthen proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine\nDAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing\nthe stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce\nTool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks\nstructural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result\nconsistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,\nreflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.\nExperiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn\ntool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These\nresults indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly\nimproves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for\nagents to learn from failure.",

        "title": "Speculate Deep and Accurate: Lossless and Training-Free Acceleration for Offloaded LLMs via Substitute Speculative Decoding",
        "abstract": "The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment\non memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter\noffloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can\ndegrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow\ninference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate\nparameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft\ntokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single\nforward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward\npasses that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on\npretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align\nwith custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model\ntraining usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from\ninsufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token\nacceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,\nwe propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading\nthat is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft\nmodel by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target\nLLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers\nand the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment.\nSubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for\nQwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for\nQwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).",

        "abstract": "Personalization is essential for adapting question answering (QA) systems to\nuser-specific information needs, thereby improving both accuracy and user\nsatisfaction. However, personalized QA remains relatively underexplored due to\nchallenges such as inferring preferences from long, noisy, and implicit\ncontexts, and generating responses that are simultaneously correct,\ncontextually appropriate, and aligned with user expectations and background\nknowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Pathways of Thoughts (PoT),\nan inference-stage method that applies to any large language model (LLM)\nwithout requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The approach models the reasoning\nof an LLM as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects\namong cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and\nclarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories,\nproducing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT\nthen aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user\npreferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the\ncomplementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA\nbenchmark for personalized QA show that PoT consistently outperforms\ncompetitive baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% relative improvement. Human\nevaluation corroborates these results, with annotators preferring outputs from\nPoT in 66% of cases and reporting ties in only 15% of cases.",

However, the primary focus on recommender systems and the use of neural networks for bridging the modality gap in recommendation scenarios does not directly align with the user's core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling."

        "title": "LOTUSDIS: A Thai far-field meeting corpus for robust conversational ASR",
        "abstract": "We present LOTUSDIS, a publicly available Thai meeting corpus designed to\nadvance far-field conversational ASR. The dataset comprises 114 hours of\nspontaneous, unscripted dialogue collected in 15-20 minute sessions with three\nparticipants, where overlapping speech is frequent and natural. Speech was\nrecorded simultaneously by nine independent single-channel devices spanning six\nmicrophone types at distances from 0.12 m to 10 m, preserving the authentic\neffects of reverberation, noise, and device coloration without relying on\nmicrophone arrays. We provide standard train, dev, test splits and release a\nreproducible baseline system. We benchmarked several Whisper variants under\nzero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Off-the-shelf models showed strong\ndegradation with distance, confirming a mismatch between pre-training data and\nThai far-field speech. Fine-tuning on LOTUSDIS dramatically improved\nrobustness: a Thai Whisper baseline reduced overall WER from 64.3 to 38.3 and\nfar-field WER from 81.6 to 49.5, with especially large gains on the most\ndistant microphones. These results underscore the importance of\ndistance-diverse training data for robust ASR. The corpus is available under\nCC-BY-SA 4.0. We also release training and evaluation scripts as a baseline\nsystem to promote reproducible research in this field.",
