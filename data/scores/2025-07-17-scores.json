        "title": "Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Structured Enterprise and Internal Data",
        "abstract": "Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR\nrecords, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical\ndecision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative\ncapabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,\nand challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative\nevaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness\n(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.\nThese results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,\ncomprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future\nwork includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based\nretrieval. The source code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot",

        "abstract": "Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.\nWith the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need\nto compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts\nand apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion\ninterpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and\nhuman biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed\nthat the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the\ninference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns,\nparticularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely\non individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the\nconclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This\nstudy used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into\nnodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic\nmeaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye\nfixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit\nhigh consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological\nstructure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into\neffective human-AI co-learning strategies.",

At the decoder, we select between two\ndocuments based on the contextual closeness of the recovered query.

Numerical simulations on synthetic and real-world data (Google NQ)\nconfirm the validity of the analysis.

While\nprior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,\ntheir capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains\nunexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic\nattributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic\ndataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international\nparticipants, we show that these models can access social media content and\npredict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic\ndataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,\nwhich may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal\nactivity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science\nin the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information\noperations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards.

        "abstract": "Traditional information extraction systems face challenges with text only\nlanguage models as it does not consider infographics (visual elements of\ninformation) such as tables, charts, images etc. often used to convey complex\ninformation to readers. Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle\nin the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial\nnumber of documents as search space. Late interaction mechanism over visual\nlanguage models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based\nvision augmented Q&A tasks. There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based\nmulti-modal Q&A. Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do\nnot support native multi-vector retrieval. Secondly, late interaction requires\ncomputation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption.\nLastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the\napproximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval\nprocess. This paper explores a pragmatic approach to make vision retrieval\nprocess scalable and efficient without compromising on performance quality. We\npropose multi-step custom implementation utilizing widely adopted hybrid search\n(metadata & embedding) and state of the art late interaction re-ranker to\nretrieve best matching pages. Finally, MLLM are prompted as reader to generate\nanswers from contextualized best matching pages.

        "title": "Language Models Improve When Pretraining Data Matches Target Tasks",
        "abstract": "Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these\ntargets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers\ndevelop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then\nrefine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make\nthis optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a\nsample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by\nsimilarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these\nscores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over\n500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to\nthem. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation\nbenchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline\n(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks\nacross all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of\nbenchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms\nbaselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models\nrequire less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly\nmatching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities\nand highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.",

This\ntask, filtered vector search, is challenging as prior state-of-the-art\ngraph-based (unfiltered) similarity search techniques quickly degenerate when\nhard constraints are considered. That is, effective graph-based filtered\nsimilarity search relies on sufficient connectivity for reaching the most\nsimilar items within just a few hops. To consider predicates, recent works\npropose modifying graph traversal to visit only the items that may satisfy\npredicates. However, they fail to offer the just-a-few-hops property for a wide\nrange of predicates: they must restrict predicates significantly or lose\nefficiency if only a small fraction of items satisfy predicates.\n  We propose an opposite approach: instead of constraining traversal, we build\nmany indexes each serving different predicate forms. For effective\nconstruction, we devise a three-dimensional analytical model capturing\nrelationships among index size, search time, and recall, with which we follow a\nworkload-aware approach to pack as many useful indexes as possible into a\ncollection. At query time, the analytical model is employed yet again to\ndiscern the one that offers the fastest search at a given recall. We show\nsuperior performance and support on datasets with varying selectivities and\nforms: our approach achieves up to 8.06x speedup while having as low as 1%\nbuild time versus other indexes, with less than 2.15x memory of a standard HNSW\ngraph and modest knowledge of past workloads.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks\nand domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm\nof Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like\nRegister-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,\ndespite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a\ndearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware\ndescription languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization\nusing various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,\nan in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally\nequivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these\nmodels across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their\nsuitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose\nChain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of\nLLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves\ngenerating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem\nstatement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These\nsteps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or\ncode) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the\nstandard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This\nmethod not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization\nbut also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs\nfor VHDL.",

Let's imagine we're in the process of\nbuilding a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social\nmedia. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several\nperspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the\ncontent creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating\nthe repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern\nacross all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes\nplace when recommender systems are almost \"too good\", making recommendations so\ntailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of\nopinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's\nperspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's\nperspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of\npotential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are\nfar-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political\ndecisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation\nof filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape?\nApproaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to\nrepresent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through\nthe lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation\nframework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and\nthe broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of\nview.",

        "abstract": "This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in\nneural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the\nintroduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the\nproperties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,\nemphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It\nproposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including\nregularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to\nstabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second\npart focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency\nby integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,\nguided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents\nsmoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need\nfor labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active\nlearning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and\ncomputational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP\ntasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform\ntraditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The\nthird part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning\nto effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive\nlabeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak\nsupervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by\nleveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive\nempirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,\nadaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic\ndata environments.",

Based on these insights, we\nintroduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated\nattention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention\nmapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that\nIAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without\nappreciably sacrificing performance.

This paradigm limits inference speed\nand parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the\ndirection and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we\npropose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla\nautoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to\nrealize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple\nsubsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a\nmasked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted\nfrom a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original\nLLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a\nlightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from\nthe predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including\na consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated\ntokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens\nquadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases\nhave demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we\nobserve that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to\nhallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose\na notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and\ncorresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to\nassist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM.

        "abstract": "Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced\nby the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a\ngender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a\nperception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese\nand Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified\nas AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic\nanalysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly\nassociated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant\nnegative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a\nsignificant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role\nof gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of\naddressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for\nfurther research to validate model performance across different linguistic\ncontexts.",

        "abstract": "Ensuring that neural models used in real-world applications cannot infer\nsensitive information, such as demographic attributes like gender or race, from\ntext representations is a critical challenge when fairness is a concern. We\naddress this issue through concept erasure, a process that removes information\nrelated to a specific concept from distributed representations while preserving\nas much of the remaining semantic information as possible. Our approach\ninvolves learning an orthogonal projection in the embedding space, designed to\nmake the class-conditional feature distributions of the discrete concept to\nerase indistinguishable after projection. By adjusting the rank of the\nprojector, we control the extent of information removal, while its\northogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the\nembeddings. Our method, termed $\\overline{\\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on\nclassic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat $\\overline{\\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear\nclassifiers, thereby promoting fairness.",

Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over\nexecutable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true\ncapabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address\nthis issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family,\nspecifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in\nRussian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming\nlanguages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that\noutlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these\ntasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct\nMERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming\nenvironments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We\nevaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in\nterms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly\nreleasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in\nmodel development, and standardize evaluation procedures.",

In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage\nframework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed\nSinglish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt\nengineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target\nexamples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize\nmodel-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic\nsimilarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation\nconfirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving\ntranslation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural\nLLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in\nlow-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP,\nwe underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world\napplications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.",
