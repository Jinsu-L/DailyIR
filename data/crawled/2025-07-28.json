        "abstract": "Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world\nNLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse\nhuman perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and\ncostly, the emerging \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm sheds light on a promising\napproach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,\nto date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona\ndescriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are\nnot generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose\nMAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically\nconstruct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant\ntext documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the\npersonas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate\nmulti-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational\nand medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results\nthat better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional\nautomated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.",

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,\nmost existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise\nallocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different\nresponse demands. Inspired by \"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\" which characterizes\ntwo distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and\nSystem 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that\ndifferent \"subregions\" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for\ntasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step\nlogical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework\nthat partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using\nfewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task\ndata via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on\nimportance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training\nSystem 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and\nintuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to\nreinforce deeper logical deliberation next.

In this paper, we describe our\nsolutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism\nIdentification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask\n1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address\neach subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck\nModel (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a\nfine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as\nhuman-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance.

Analysis of\nthese reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to\nidentify and code relevant cases.

We evaluated whether a fully\nautomated, open source \"text-to-table\" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)\ncould reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide\nPFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD\nreports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD\nToolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases\nwhere the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or\nyounger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern\nsub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72\nchild-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded\nclinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the\nchild-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the\nLLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's\n$\\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script\nruntime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one\nthat can be completed in minutes.

However,\nthis emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges. First, the\nsubstantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise\nurgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection. Second, their\npowerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce\nmisleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. To address these concerns,\nwe explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding\nimperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain\ndetectable by specialized algorithms. We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking\nframework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models. Waltz\nis inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are\nrarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold\ntokens''. Leveraging this insight, Waltz embeds watermarks by rewiring the\nsimilarity statistics between patch embeddings and cold token embeddings, and\ndetects watermarks using similarity z-scores. To minimize potential side\neffects, we introduce a similarity-based embedding position identification\nstrategy and employ projected gradient descent to constrain the watermark noise\nwithin a defined boundary. Extensive experiments using two popular LLMTS models\nacross seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Waltz achieves high watermark\ndetection accuracy with minimal impact on the quality of the generated time\nseries.",

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the\noriginal training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.\nThrough empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and\nBunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming\nto compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or\nsufficient data.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph\nCompletion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as\nblack-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC\nmethods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of\nerroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and\ndecisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural\ninformation with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of\nLLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge.\nWe propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first\nleverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural\ninformation into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction\nalgorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)\nthat needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format\ncomprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing\nmainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

        "abstract": "Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media-including hate speech, harassment,\nand trolling-poses growing challenges for platform safety and societal\nwellbeing. While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content\nafter it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful\nbehaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user\nrecidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field\nremains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing\nmethods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB\nprediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm\ndetection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral\nrisk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks\ndiffer by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In\naddition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine\nlearning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset\ncharacteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights\nmethodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and\nlimited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including\nmultilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop\nsystems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims\nto guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB\nprediction.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in recommender systems rely on external resources such as\nknowledge graphs or large language models to enhance recommendations, which\nlimit applicability in real-world settings due to data dependency and\ncomputational overhead. Although knowledge-free models are able to bolster\nrecommendations by direct edge operations as well, the absence of augmentation\nprimitives drives them to fall short in bridging semantic and structural gaps\nas high-quality paradigm substitutes. Unlike existing diffusion-based works\nthat remodel user-item interactions, this work proposes NodeDiffRec, a\npioneering knowledge-free augmentation framework that enables fine-grained\nnode-level graph generation for recommendations and expands the scope of\nrestricted augmentation primitives via diffusion. By synthesizing pseudo-items\nand corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for\ninjection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference\nmodeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and\nstructural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the\nsuperiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with\nmaximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5\nover selected baselines.",

Users often require varied and highly customizable\npolicies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.\nConsequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies\nand adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing\nfine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,\nrestricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive\nretraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited\ncontext lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies\ncomprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's\njudgment on \"precedents\", which are the reasoning processes of prior data\npoints similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed\npolicies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the\nguardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for\ncollecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents\nfor robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios\nand exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.",

Edges in real-world networks often have timestamps, so there\nis a need for temporal motif mining. A temporal motif is a richer structure\nthat imposes timing constraints on the edges of the motif. Temporal motifs have\nbeen used to analyze social networks, financial transactions, and biological\nnetworks.\n  Motif counting in temporal graphs is particularly challenging. A graph with\nmillions of edges can have trillions of temporal motifs, since the same edge\ncan occur with multiple timestamps. There is a combinatorial explosion of\npossibilities, and state-of-the-art algorithms cannot manage motifs with more\nthan four vertices.\n  In this work, we present TIMEST: a general, fast, and accurate estimation\nalgorithm to count temporal motifs of arbitrary sizes in temporal networks. Our\napproach introduces a temporal spanning tree sampler that leverages weighted\nsampling to generate substructures of target temporal motifs. This method\ncarefully takes a subset of temporal constraints of the motif that can be\njointly and efficiently sampled. TIMEST uses randomized estimation techniques\nto obtain accurate estimates of motif counts.\n  We give theoretical guarantees on the running time and approximation\nguarantees of TIMEST. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and show\nthat TIMEST is both faster and more accurate than previous algorithms. Our CPU\nimplementation exhibits an average speedup of 28x over state-of-the-art GPU\nimplementation of the exact algorithm, and 6x speedup over SOTA approximate\nalgorithms while consistently showcasing less than 5% error in most cases.

To overcome these issues, we\npropose a novel Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State\nAbstraction (TADT-CSA) model. Specifically, we combine the conventional\nReturn-To-Go (RTG) signal with a novel temporal advantage (TA) signal that\nencourages the model to capture both long-term returns and their sequential\ntrend. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive state abstraction module into\nthe DT framework to learn more effective and expressive state representations.\nWithin this module, we introduce a TA-conditioned State Vector Quantization\n(TAC-SVQ) strategy, where the TA score guides the state codebooks to\nincorporate contextual token information. Additionally, a reward prediction\nnetwork and a contrastive transition prediction (CTP) network are employed to\nensure the state codebook preserves both the reward information of the current\nstate and the transition information between adjacent states. Empirical results\non both public datasets and an online recommendation system demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the TADT-CSA model and its superiority over baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language\nprocessing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in\ndialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This\nlinguistic divide limits access to digital services and educational resources\nand impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two\ncore contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian,\nand Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained\nsettings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and\nthe development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of\nprompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that\nfew-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and\nour proposed Ara-TEaR method. GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across\nall prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a\nCHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint\nmulti-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over\n10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than\n1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a\npractical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing\nthat high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited\nresources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.",

Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can\nexacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations\nin model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable\ninclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the\nstance of responses to validate the normative alignment.

Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy\nlearning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad\napplicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization\nbased on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages\nan on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines\nresponses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct\npreference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and\npolicy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality\npreference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible\nimprovements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning\noutputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the\nproposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline\nself-improving methods without using external preference data.",

We show\nthat policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common\noccurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This\ntheoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly\ndisparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards\nthat may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action\ndegeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting\nto the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how\nstability is governed by an \"effective reward\" aggregation mechanism. We also\nprove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of\nincreased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for\nrecent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following\ntrade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through\nperturbation experiments in multi-reward RL.

To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which\nintroduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each\nspeech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of\nword-level prosody tokens.

While RAG\ndemonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from\ngeneral-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic,\ndiverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems\nusing MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and\nidentified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models,\nrerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently\nexcels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous\nknowledge sources.

        "abstract": "The uninterpretability of DNNs has led to the adoption of abstract\ninterpretation-based certification as a practical means to establish trust in\nreal-world systems that rely on DNNs. However, the current landscape supports\nonly a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing\nones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the\nmathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their\nimplementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch\ncreates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual\nbridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in\nformal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level\nspecifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level\nimplementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based\nintermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit\ntensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During\nlifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to\nperform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific\noptimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations\nexhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align\nwell with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a\ndouble-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of\nvarying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.\n  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and\nanalyze their utility across diverse DNNs. Despite its flexibility, the\ncompiler achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations.",

In contrast with traditional univariate recommendation models,\nchoice models consider which competitors appeared with the chosen item. This\nability allows them to distinguish whether a user chose an item due to\npreference, i.e., they liked it; or competition, i.e., it was the best\navailable option. Each choice model assumes specific user behavior, e.g., the\nmultinomial logit model. However, it is currently unclear how accurately these\nassumptions capture actual user behavior, how wrong assumptions impact\ninference, and whether better models exist.\n  In this work, we propose the learned choice model for recommendation\n(LCM4Rec), a non-parametric method for estimating the choice model. By applying\nkernel density estimation, LCM4Rec infers the most likely error distribution\nthat describes the effect of inter-item cannibalization and thereby\ncharacterizes the users' choice model.

Our experimental results indicate that\nour method (i) can accurately recover the choice model underlying a dataset;\n(ii) provides robust user preference inference, in contrast with existing\nchoice models that are only effective when their assumptions match user\nbehavior; and (iii) is more resistant against exposure bias than existing\nchoice models.

While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates\nthis process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows\nlinearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a\nbottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques,\nincluding token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been\nproposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This\npaper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages\nthe observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the\nremoval of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction\nusually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under\nhigh compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{CaliDrop}, a\nnovel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our\npreliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high\nsimilarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative\ncalibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by\ntoken eviction.

Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)\nmethods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then\nalign variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based\napproaches.

        "title": "CleANN: Efficient Full Dynamism in Graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search",
        "abstract": "Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) has become a quintessential\nalgorithmic problem for various other foundational data tasks for AI workloads.\nGraph-based ANNS indexes have superb empirical trade-offs in indexing cost,\nquery efficiency, and query approximation quality. Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse\ndatasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at\nleast as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding\ndata. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of\nqueries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x\nthroughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets. To the best of our\nknowledge, CleANN is the first concurrent ANNS index to achieve such efficiency\nwhile maintaining quality under full dynamism.",

        "abstract": "Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models\n(LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and\nsubstantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have\nattempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods\noften require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in\nlength and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present\nlong-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an\neffortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can\nmarkedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling\nshort instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate\nresponses based on long-context meta-instructions. This enables Flora to\nproduce contexts of arbitrary length and scale with rich diversity, while only\nslightly compromising short-context performance. Experiments on\nLlama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B show that LLMs enhanced by Flora excel in three\nlong-context benchmarks while maintaining strong performances in short-context\ntasks.

However, traditional\nRL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to\nlong-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement\nLearning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning\nabilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short\nsegments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail\nsamples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive\nTokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment\nrollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with\n128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\\% to\n85.1\\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\\% to 61.9\\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B\nwith remarkable gains.

        "abstract": "This paper presents HITSZ's submission for the IWSLT 2025 Indic track,\nfocusing on speech-to-text translation (ST) for English-to-Indic and\nIndic-to-English language pairs. To enhance translation quality in this\nlow-resource scenario, we propose an end-to-end system integrating the\npre-trained Whisper automated speech recognition (ASR) model with Krutrim, an\nIndic-specialized large language model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our end-to-end system achieved average BLEU scores of $28.88$ for\nEnglish-to-Indic directions and $27.86$ for Indic-to-English directions.\nFurthermore, we investigated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. While this\nmethod showed potential for significant translation quality improvements on\nsuccessfully parsed outputs (e.g. a $13.84$ BLEU increase for\nTamil-to-English), we observed challenges in ensuring the model consistently\nadheres to the required CoT output format.",

        "title": "MOCHA: Are Code Language Models Robust Against Multi-Turn Malicious Coding Prompts?",
        "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly\nenhanced their code generation capabilities. However, their robustness against\nadversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts,\nremains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks,\nwhere a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign\nsubtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To\nfacilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \\benchmarkname{}, a large-scale\nbenchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both\nsingle-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open-\nand closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under\nmulti-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while\npreserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external\nadversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any\nadditional supervision.",

        "title": "Efficient Attention Mechanisms for Large Language Models: A Survey",
        "abstract": "Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large\nlanguage models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of\nself-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context\nmodeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two\nprincipal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention\nmethods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent\nformulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with\nreduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit\nattention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns,\nblock-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while\npreserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and\ncomprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic\ninnovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the\nincorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language\nmodels, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and\nhybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning\ntheoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to\nserve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and\nefficient language models.",

        "title": "Mitigating Geospatial Knowledge Hallucination in Large Language Models: Benchmarking and Dynamic Factuality Aligning",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including\ngeospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial\ntasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However,\nLLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial\nhallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial\ninformation) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general\nknowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic\nevaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely\nunexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation\nframework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial\nknowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across\n20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge.\nBuilding on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method\nbased on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial\nhallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on\nthe proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the\ntrustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.",
