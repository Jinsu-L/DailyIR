        "title": "Training AI Co-Scientists Using Rubric Rewards",
        "abstract": "AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.",

        "title": "Eliciting Behaviors in Multi-Turn Conversations",
        "abstract": "Identifying specific and often complex behaviors from large language models (LLMs) in conversational settings is crucial for their evaluation. Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "We present a method and dataset for fine-tuning language models with preference supervision using feedback-driven improvement chains. Given a model response, an annotator provides fine-grained feedback by marking ``liked'' and ``disliked'' spans and specifying what they liked or disliked about them. The base model then rewrites the disliked spans accordingly, proceeding from left to right, forming a sequence of incremental improvements. We construct preference pairs for direct alignment from each adjacent step in the chain, enabling the model to learn from localized, targeted edits. We find that our approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, demonstrating that structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning.",

        "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.\n  Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench\n  Code: https://github.com/prdeepakbabu/ProfASR-Bench",

However, LLMs are vulnerable to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks. In this work, we construct a dataset of approximately 500 real academic papers accepted to ICML and evaluate the effect of embedding hidden adversarial prompts within these documents. Each paper is injected with semantically equivalent instructions in four different languages and reviewed using an LLM. We find that prompt injection induces substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, while Arabic injections produce little to no effect. These results highlight the susceptibility of LLM-based reviewing systems to document-level prompt injection and reveal notable differences in vulnerability across languages.",

        "abstract": "Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

While full browser interaction could unlock deeper capabilities, its fine-grained control and verbose page content returns introduce substantial complexity for ReAct-style function-calling agents. To bridge this gap, we propose Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse), which introduces a minimal and complete browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration through a nested structure. This design simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web information acquisition. Empirical results on challenging deep IS benchmarks demonstrate that NestBrowse offers clear benefits in practice. Further in-depth analyses underscore its efficiency and flexibility.",

        "abstract": "The quest for seeking health information has swamped the web with consumers health-related questions. Generally, con- sumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding. One way to address this challenge is to summarize the questions and distill the key information of the original question. Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media. We benchmark the dataset on multiple state-of-the-art summarization models to show the effectiveness of the dataset",

Existing approaches suffer from three fundamental challenges: expensive human annotation for high-quality trajectories, poor generalization to unseen tools, and quality ceilings inherent in single-model synthesis that perpetuate biases and coverage gaps. We introduce InfTool, a fully autonomous framework that breaks these barriers through self-evolving multi-agent synthesis. Given only raw API specifications, InfTool orchestrates three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, and MCP Server) to generate diverse, verified trajectories spanning single-turn calls to complex multi-step workflows. The framework establishes a closed loop: synthesized data trains the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards, the improved model generates higher-quality data targeting capability gaps, and this cycle iterates without human intervention. Experiments on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) demonstrate that InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258%), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, and entirely from synthetic data without human annotation.",

        "abstract": "China's marriage registrations have declined dramatically, dropping from 13.47 million couples in 2013 to 6.1 million in 2024. Understanding public attitudes toward marriage requires examining not only emotional sentiment but also the moral reasoning underlying these evaluations. This study analyzed 219,358 marriage-related posts from two major Chinese social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu) using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral dimensions (Autonomy, Community, Divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo discourse skewed positive, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts across both platforms lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral ethics were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking Autonomy ethics and Community ethics were predominantly negative, whereas Divinity-framed posts tended toward neutral or positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations drive negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China. The study demonstrates LLMs' utility for scaling qualitative analysis and offers insights for developing culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline in Chinese contexts.",

        "abstract": "The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.",

We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts.",

        "abstract": "Following the initial flourishing of large language models (LLMs), there has been a surge in proposed large vision-language models (LVLMs) that integrate LLMs with vision capabilities. However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities.",

        "abstract": "Multi-model routing has evolved from an engineering technique into essential infrastructure, yet existing work lacks a systematic, reproducible benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). We present VL-RouterBench to assess the overall capability of VLM routing systems systematically. The benchmark is grounded in raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs and constructs quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs. In scale, VL-RouterBench covers 14 datasets across 3 task groups, totaling 30,540 samples, and includes 15 open-source models and 2 API models, yielding 519,180 sample-model pairs and a total input-output token volume of 34,494,977. The evaluation protocol jointly measures average accuracy, average cost, and throughput, and builds a ranking score from the harmonic mean of normalized cost and accuracy to enable comparison across router configurations and cost budgets. On this benchmark, we evaluate 10 routing methods and baselines and observe a significant routability gain, while the best current routers still show a clear gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating considerable room for improvement in router architecture through finer visual cues and modeling of textual structure. We will open-source the complete data construction and evaluation toolchain to promote comparability, reproducibility, and practical deployment in multimodal routing research.",

        "abstract": "Hallucinations, the generation of apparently convincing yet false statements, remain a major barrier to the safe deployment of LLMs. Building on the strong performance of self-detection methods, we examine the use of structured knowledge representations, namely knowledge graphs, to improve hallucination self-detection. Specifically, we propose a simple yet powerful approach that enriches hallucination self-detection by (i) converting LLM responses into knowledge graphs of entities and relations, and (ii) using these graphs to estimate the likelihood that a response contains hallucinations. We evaluate the proposed approach using two widely used LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across two hallucination detection datasets. To support more reliable future benchmarking, one of these datasets has been manually curated and enhanced and is released as a secondary outcome of this work. Compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT, a state-of-the-art approach, our method achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score. Our results show that LLMs can better analyse atomic facts when they are structured as knowledge graphs, even when initial outputs contain inaccuracies. This low-cost, model-agnostic approach paves the way toward safer and more trustworthy language models.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are highly vulnerable to input confirmation bias. When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation.",

Unlike existing text reuse frameworks that struggle with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations, ACT combines a morphology-aware alignment algorithm with a context-sensitive enrichment stage that identifies complex citation patterns such as \"Wave\" and \"Echo\" quotations.\n  Our approach was evaluated against leading systems, including Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, as well as human-annotated critical editions. We further assessed three ACT configurations to isolate the contribution of each component. Results demonstrate that the full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperforms all baselines, achieving an F1 score of 0.91, with superior Recall (0.89) and Precision (0.94). Notably, ACT-2, which lacks stylistic enrichment, achieves higher Recall (0.90) but suffers in Precision, while ACT-3, using longer n-grams, offers a tradeoff between coverage and specificity.\n  In addition to improving quotation detection, ACT's ability to classify stylistic patterns across corpora opens new avenues for genre classification and intertextual analysis. This work contributes to digital humanities and computational philology by addressing the methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment. ACT lays a foundation for broader applications in historical textual analysis, especially in morphologically rich and citation-dense traditions like Aggadic literature.",

        "abstract": "Semantic text classification has undergone significant advances in recent years due to the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their high dimensional embeddings. While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster - the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 News- groups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets.",

To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning. We also propose a diagnostic framework to isolate these cognitive bottlenecks by providing external solver tools.

However, like other neural architectures, they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations: subtle character-, word-, or phrase-level perturbations can poison retrieval results and artificially promote targeted candidates, undermining the integrity of search engines and downstream systems. Existing defenses either rely on heuristics with poor generalization or on certified methods that assume overly strong adversarial knowledge, limiting their practical use. To address these challenges, we propose RobustMask, a novel defense that combines the context-prediction capability of pretrained language models with a randomized masking-based smoothing mechanism. Our approach strengthens neural ranking models against adversarial perturbations at the character, word, and phrase levels. Leveraging both the pairwise comparison ability of ranking models and probabilistic statistical analysis, we provide a theoretical proof of RobustMask's certified top-K robustness. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that RobustMask successfully certifies over 20% of candidate documents within the top-10 ranking positions against adversarial perturbations affecting up to 30% of their content. These results highlight the effectiveness of RobustMask in enhancing the adversarial robustness of neural ranking models, marking a significant step toward providing stronger security guarantees for real-world retrieval systems.",

Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features. Our work demonstrates that incorporating mechanistic interpretability into the fine-tuning process can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency.",

Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training.

We then test popular open-weight LLMs for generating TLDRs based on abstracts. Our analysis reveals that, although some of them successfully produce humanoid summaries, LLMs generally exhibit a greater affinity for the original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, hence tend to be more extractive rather than abstractive in general, compared to humans.

In this study, we target computational efficiency by focusing on a matrix multiplication free language model (MatMul-free LM) and further reducing the training cost through an architecture inspired by reservoir computing. Specifically, we partially fix and share the weights of selected layers in the MatMul-free LM and insert reservoir layers to obtain rich dynamic representations without additional training overhead. Additionally, several operations are combined to reduce memory accesses. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture reduces the number of parameters by up to 19%, training time by 9.9%, and inference time by 8.0%, while maintaining comparable performance to the baseline model.",

ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). The model supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging. TabiBERT attains 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and establishing state-of-the-art on five of eight categories: question answering (+9.55), code retrieval (+2.41), and document retrieval (+0.60). Compared with task-specific prior best results, including specialized models like TurkishBERTweet, TabiBERT achieves +1.47 average improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization.

We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative. On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT. We therefore caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocate a broader interpretability toolkit, including causal mediation and corruption-based metrics.",

Current LLMs cannot natively ingest long-duration sensor streams, and paired sensor-text datasets are scarce. To address these challenges, we introduce LENS, a framework that aligns multimodal sensing data with language models to generate clinically grounded mental-health narratives. LENS first constructs a large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses related to depression and anxiety symptoms into natural-language descriptions, yielding over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants. To enable native time-series integration, we train a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into an LLM's representation space. Our results show that LENS outperforms strong baselines on standard NLP metrics and task-specific measures of symptom-severity accuracy. A user study with 13 mental-health professionals further indicates that LENS-produced narratives are comprehensive and clinically meaningful. Ultimately, our approach advances LLMs as interfaces for health sensing, providing a scalable path toward models that can reason over raw behavioral signals and support downstream clinical decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance across natural language tasks but incur substantial computational and storage costs due to their scale. Post-training structured pruning offers an efficient solution. However, when few-shot calibration sets fail to adequately reflect the pretraining data distribution, existing methods exhibit limited generalization to downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG), a post-training pruning framework that alleviates calibration bias by identifying and preserving neurons critical to specific function. FANG groups neurons with similar function based on the type of semantic context they process and prunes each group independently. During importance estimation within each group, tokens that strongly correlate with the functional role of the neuron group are given higher weighting. Additionally, FANG also preserves neurons that contribute across multiple context types. To achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance, it allocates sparsity to each block adaptively based on its functional complexity. Experiments show that FANG improves downstream accuracy while preserving language modeling performance. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results when combined with FLAP and OBC, two representative pruning methods. Specifically, FANG outperforms FLAP and OBC by 1.5%--8.5% in average accuracy under 30% and 40% sparsity.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in medical knowledge assessments, yet their practical utility in real-world clinical decision-making remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs-ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LIama 3.3 70B-in clinical decision support across the entire clinical reasoning workflow of a typical patient encounter. Using 36 case studies, we first assessed LLM's out-of-the-box performance across five key sequential clinical decision-making tasks under two temperature settings (default vs. zero): differential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. All models showed high variability by task, achieving near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in relevant diagnostic testing, and moderate performance in remaining tasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT performed better under the zero temperature, whereas LIama showed stronger performance under the default temperature. Next, we assessed whether prompt engineering could enhance LLM performance by applying variations of the MedPrompt framework, incorporating targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that prompt engineering is not a one-size-fit-all solution. While it significantly improved the performance on the task with lowest baseline accuracy (relevant diagnostic testing), it was counterproductive for others. Another key finding was that the targeted dynamic few-shot prompting did not consistently outperform random selection, indicating that the presumed benefits of closely matched examples may be counterbalanced by loss of broader contextual diversity. These findings suggest that the impact of prompt engineering is highly model and task-dependent, highlighting the need for tailored, context-aware strategies for integrating LLMs into healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.",

To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.",

        "abstract": "Clinical notes are often stored in unstructured or semi-structured formats after extraction from electronic medical record (EMR) systems, which complicates their use for secondary analysis and downstream clinical applications. Reliable identification of section boundaries is a key step toward structuring these notes, as sections such as history of present illness, medications, and discharge instructions each provide distinct clinical contexts. In this work, we evaluate rule-based baselines, domain-specific transformer models, and large language models for clinical note segmentation using a curated dataset of 1,000 notes from MIMIC-IV. Our experiments show that large API-based models achieve the best overall performance, with GPT-5-mini reaching a best average F1 of 72.4 across sentence-level and freetext segmentation. Lightweight baselines remain competitive on structured sentence-level tasks but falter on unstructured freetext. Our results provide guidance for method selection and lay the groundwork for downstream tasks such as information extraction, cohort identification, and automated summarization.",

        "abstract": "Misinformation on social media is a widely acknowledged issue, and researchers worldwide are actively engaged in its detection. However, low-resource languages such as Urdu have received limited attention in this domain. An obvious approach is to utilize a multilingual pretrained language model and fine-tune it for a downstream classification task, such as misinformation detection. However, these models struggle with domain-specific terms, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of domain adaptation before fine-tuning for fake news classification in Urdu, employing a staged training approach to optimize model generalization. We evaluate two widely used multilingual models, XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT, and apply domain-adaptive pretraining using a publicly available Urdu news corpus. Experiments on four publicly available Urdu fake news datasets show that domain-adapted XLM-R consistently outperforms its vanilla counterpart, while domain-adapted mBERT exhibits mixed results.",

        "abstract": "Human-interaction-involved applications underscore the need for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). Although many approaches have been proposed to address the subtle emotions in different modalities, the power of explanations and temporal alignments is still underexplored. Thus, this paper proposes the Text-routed sparse mixture-of-Experts model with eXplanation and Temporal alignment for MSA (TEXT). TEXT first augments explanations for MSA via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM), and then novelly aligns the epresentations of audio and video through a temporality-oriented neural network block. TEXT aligns different modalities with explanations and facilitates a new text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion. Our temporal alignment block merges the benefits of Mamba and temporal cross-attention. As a result, TEXT achieves the best performance cross four datasets among all tested models, including three recently proposed approaches and three MLLMs. TEXT wins on at least four metrics out of all six metrics. For example, TEXT decreases the mean absolute error to 0.353 on the CH-SIMS dataset, which signifies a 13.5% decrement compared with recently proposed approaches.",

However, adapting general-domain Large Language Models (LLMs) to this task is often hampered by their lack of domain-specific knowledge and the performance degradation caused by low-quality training data. To address these challenges, we introduce BioSelectTune, a highly efficient, data-centric framework for fine-tuning LLMs that prioritizes data quality over quantity. Methods and Results: BioSelectTune reformulates BioNER as a structured JSON generation task and leverages our novel Hybrid Superfiltering strategy, a weak-to-strong data curation method that uses a homologous weak model to distill a compact, high-impact training dataset. Conclusions: Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BioSelectTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple BioNER benchmarks. Notably, our model, trained on only 50% of the curated positive data, not only surpasses the fully-trained baseline but also outperforms powerful domain-specialized models like BioMedBERT.",

        "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) generation is the standard decoding paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), but its token-by-token nature limits parallelism at inference time. Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding by recovering multiple masked tokens per step; however, in practice they often fail to translate this parallelism into deployment speed gains over optimized AR engines (e.g., vLLM). A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions. Building on this property, we introduce a streaming decoding procedure that continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains a fixed parallel workload, avoiding the stop-and-wait behavior common in block diffusion methods. Experiments show that WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups, approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes; critically, our comparisons are against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings, demonstrating that diffusion-style decoding can outperform an optimized AR engine in practice.",

        "abstract": "Infant mortality remains a significant public health concern in the United States, with birth defects identified as a leading cause. Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additionally, it provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups. In a broader context, our research showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate population responses, a method known as ``Silicon Sampling''. However, responses to socially sensitive questions frequently exhibit Social Desirability Bias (SDB), diverging from real human data toward socially acceptable answers. Existing studies on social desirability bias in LLM-based sampling remain limited. In this work, we investigate whether minimal, psychologically grounded prompt wording can mitigate this bias and improve alignment between silicon and human samples. We conducted a study using data from the American National Election Study (ANES) on three LLMs from two model families: the open-source Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini. We first replicate a baseline silicon sampling study, confirming the persistent Social Desirability Bias. We then test four prompt-based mitigation methods: \\emph{reformulated} (neutral, third-person phrasing), \\emph{reverse-coded} (semantic inversion), and two meta-instructions, \\emph{priming} and \\emph{preamble}, respectively encouraging analytics and sincerity. Alignment with ANES is evaluated using Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results demonstrate that reformulated prompts most effectively improve alignment by reducing distribution concentration on socially acceptable answers and achieving distributions closer to ANES. Reverse-coding produced mixed results across eligible items, while the Priming and Preamble encouraged response uniformity and showed no systematic benefit for bias mitigation. Our findings validate the efficacy of prompt-based framing controls in mitigating inherent Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, providing a practical path toward more representative silicon samples.",

We introduce a human-validated framework to evaluate whether model-generated reasoning traces logically support their conclusions across languages. Analyzing 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models, we uncover a critical blind spot: while models achieve high task accuracy, their reasoning can fail to support their conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least twice as much misalignment between their reasoning and conclusions than those in Latin scripts. We develop an error taxonomy through human annotation to characterize these failures, finding they stem primarily from evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps. Our findings demonstrate that current multilingual evaluation practices provide an incomplete picture of model reasoning capabilities and highlight the need for reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks.",

This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with a focus on Urdu. Using pretrained transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT, we apply simple preprocessing and train classifiers for improved results. Evaluations on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark demonstrate strong performance, achieving F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with similarly competitive results in Spanish, German, and English. These results highlight the possibility of implementing existing multilingual models in low-resource environments, thus making it easier to identify hope speech and helping to build a more constructive digital discourse.",

We present a systematic study of Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) applied to next-token prediction in transformer-based models with large vocabularies (greater than 250,000 tokens). Our central contribution is the identification of a coverage-efficiency tradeoff: while naive conformal prediction achieves valid coverage, it produces prediction sets of hundreds of tokens, rendering them uninformative. We propose Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a framework that leverages semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage. Experiments on Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks demonstrate that VACP achieves 89.7 percent empirical coverage (90 percent target) while reducing the mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens -- a 197x improvement in efficiency.

        "abstract": "Structured width pruning of GLU-MLP layers, guided by the Maximum Absolute Weight (MAW) criterion, reveals a systematic dichotomy in how reducing the expansion ratio affects different model capabilities. While performance on tasks relying on parametric knowledge (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and perplexity metrics degrades predictably, instruction-following capabilities improve substantially (+46% to +75% in IFEval for Llama-3.2-1B and 3B models), and multi-step reasoning remains robust (MUSR). This pattern challenges the prevailing assumption that pruning induces uniform degradation. We evaluated seven expansion ratio configurations using comprehensive benchmarks assessing factual knowledge, mathematical reasoning, language comprehension, instruction-following, and truthfulness. Our analysis identifies the expansion ratio as a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities, rather than merely serving as a compression metric. We provide the first systematic characterization of this selective preservation phenomenon. Notably, we document a robust inverse correlation (r = -0.864, p = 0.012 in Llama-3B) between factual knowledge capacity (MMLU) and truthfulness metrics (TruthfulQA-MC2): as knowledge degrades, the model's ability to discriminate misconceptions improves consistently. This connects two previously distinct research areas, demonstrating that MAW-guided width pruning acts as a selective filter, reducing parametric knowledge while preserving or enhancing behavioral alignment. Additionally, we quantify context-dependent efficiency trade-offs: pruned configurations achieve up to 23% reduction in energy consumption (J/token) but incur penalties in single-request latency, whereas batch processing workloads benefit uniformly.",

However, many real-world tasks involve multi-stage pipeline whose final outcomes lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data to train robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulate error over stages. We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. We hope our findings serve as the first step toward to scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation.",

        "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies show that CoT explanations often fail to reflect the model's actual reasoning process, as models may produce coherent yet misleading justifications or modify answers without acknowledging external cues. Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of CoT-based methods for safety supervision and alignment monitoring, as models can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers. To better understand this limitation, we evaluate two optimization methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in their ability to improve CoT faithfulness. Our experiments show that GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model attaining the best results across all evaluation metrics. Both approaches exhibit positive correlations between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics, albeit with less stable behavior at smaller scales. These results suggest that GRPO offers a promising direction for developing more transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.",

In this paper, we revisit diffusion language modeling from the view of diffusion process and language modeling, and outline five properties that separate diffusion mechanics from language-specific requirements. We first categorize existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. We then show that each satisfies only part of the five essential properties and therefore reflects a structural trade-off. Through analyses of recent large diffusion language models, we identify two central issues: (i) uniform corruption does not respect how information is distributed across positions, and (ii) token-wise marginal training cannot capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding.

        "abstract": "As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems evolve toward more sophisticated architectures, ensuring their trustworthiness through explainable and robust evaluation becomes critical. Existing scalar metrics suffer from limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies. We introduce DICE (Discrete Interpretable Comparative Evaluation), a two-stage, evidence-coupled framework that advances explainability and robustness in RAG evaluation. DICE combines deep analytical reasoning with probabilistic $\\{A, B, Tie\\}$ scoring to produce transparent, confidence-aware judgments that support accountable system improvement through interpretable reasoning traces, enabling systematic error diagnosis and actionable insights. To address efficiency challenges at scale, DICE employs a Swiss-system tournament that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \\log N)$, achieving a 42.9% reduction in our eight-system evaluation while preserving ranking fidelity. Validation on a curated Chinese financial QA dataset demonstrates that DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts, substantially outperforming existing LLM-based metrics such as RAGAS. Our results establish DICE as a responsible, explainable, and efficient paradigm for trustworthy RAG system assessment.",

We introduce M2G-Eval, a multi-granularity, multilingual framework for evaluating code generation in large language models (LLMs) across four levels: Class, Function, Block, and Line. Spanning 18 programming languages, M2G-Eval includes 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated, contamination-controlled test instances. We develop M2G-Eval-Coder models by training Qwen3-8B with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. Evaluating 30 models (28 state-of-the-art LLMs plus our two M2G-Eval-Coder variants) reveals three main findings: (1) an apparent difficulty hierarchy, with Line-level tasks easiest and Class-level most challenging; (2) widening performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages as task complexity increases; and (3) strong cross-language correlations, suggesting that models learn transferable programming concepts. M2G-Eval enables fine-grained diagnosis of code generation capabilities and highlights persistent challenges in synthesizing complex, long-form code.",

        "abstract": "With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), diverse time series analysis tasks are reformulated as time series question answering (TSQA) through a unified natural language interface. However, existing LLM-based approaches largely adopt general natural language processing techniques and are prone to reasoning errors when handling complex numerical sequences. Different from purely textual tasks, time series data are inherently verifiable, enabling consistency checking between reasoning steps and the original input. Motivated by this property, we propose T3LLM, which performs multi-step reasoning with an explicit correction mechanism for time series question answering. The T3LLM framework consists of three LLMs, namely, a worker, a reviewer, and a student, that are responsible for generation, review, and reasoning learning, respectively. Within this framework, the worker generates step-wise chains of thought (CoT) under structured prompts, while the reviewer inspects the reasoning, identifies erroneous steps, and provides corrective comments. The collaboratively generated corrected CoT are used to fine-tune the student model, internalizing multi-step reasoning and self-correction into its parameters. Experiments on multiple real-world TSQA benchmarks demonstrate that T3LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance over strong LLM-based baselines.",

In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1.

Similarly, we demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn to dynamically determine when to attend to global context. We propose All-or-Here Attention (AHA), which utilizes a binary router per attention head to dynamically toggle between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token. Our results indicate that with a window size of 256 tokens, up to 93\\% of the original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss. Furthermore, by evaluating AHA across various window sizes, we identify a long-tail distribution in context dependency, where the necessity for full attention decays rapidly as the local window expands. By decoupling local processing from global access, AHA reveals that full attention is largely redundant, and that efficient inference requires only on-demand access to the global context.",

This paper proposes ManchuTTS(Manchu Text to Speech), a novel approach tailored to Manchu's linguistic characteristics. To handle agglutination, this method designs a three-tier text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic) and a cross-modal hierarchical attention mechanism for multi-granular alignment. The synthesis model integrates deep convolutional networks with a flow-matching Transformer, enabling efficient, non-autoregressive generation. This method further introduce a hierarchical contrastive loss to guide structured acoustic-linguistic correspondence. To address low-resource constraints, This method construct the first Manchu TTS dataset and employ a data augmentation strategy. Experiments demonstrate that ManchuTTS attains a MOS of 4.52 using a 5.2-hour training subset derived from our full 6.24-hour annotated corpus, outperforming all baseline models by a notable margin. Ablations confirm hierarchical guidance improves agglutinative word pronunciation accuracy (AWPA) by 31% and prosodic naturalness by 27%.",

A comparative analysis shows that, under explicit normalization assumptions, the Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be treated as representationally equivalent at the eojeol based constituency level. Building on this result, we outline an eojeol based annotation scheme that preserves interpretable constituency and supports cross treebank comparison and constituency dependency conversion.",

Our key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from a non-linear to a linear transformation during training, allowing the adapter to initially adopt stronger representational capabilities before converging to a mergeable linear form.

Integrating LLMs with professional fields and redefining the relationship between LLMs and domain-specific applications has become a critical challenge for promoting enterprise digital transformation and broader social development. To effectively integrate LLMs into the accounting domain, it is essential to understand their domain-specific reasoning capabilities. This study introduces the concept of vertical-domain accounting reasoning and establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing the training data characteristics of representative GLM-series models. These criteria provide a foundation for subsequent research on reasoning paradigms and offer benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance. Based on this framework, we evaluate several representative models, including GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4, on a set of accounting reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that different prompt engineering strategies lead to varying degrees of performance improvement across models, with GPT-4 achieving the strongest accounting reasoning capability. However, current LLMs still fall short of real-world application requirements. In particular, further optimization is needed for deployment in enterprise-level accounting scenarios to fully realize the potential value of LLMs in this domain.",

However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

To address this, we integrate the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework that operates independently of LLM-based judgments, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high detection accuracy. We conduct a comparative analysis of hallucination detection methods across various LLMs, evaluating True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and Accuracy on question-answering (QA) and summarization tasks. Our results show that HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes, while HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves the highest accuracy \\(82.2\\%\\) and TPR \\(78.9\\%\\). However, HHEM struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks. To address this, we introduce segment-based retrieval, improving detection by verifying smaller text components. Additionally, our cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis indicates that larger models (7B-9B parameters) generally exhibit fewer hallucinations, while intermediate-sized models show higher instability. These findings highlight the need for structured evaluation frameworks that balance computational efficiency with robust factual validation, enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated content.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation. However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.",

        "title": "OxygenREC: An Instruction-Following Generative Framework for E-commerce Recommendation",
        "abstract": "Traditional recommendation systems suffer from inconsistency in multi-stage optimization objectives. Generative Recommendation (GR) mitigates them through an end-to-end framework; however, existing methods still rely on matching mechanisms based on inductive patterns. Although responsive, they lack the ability to uncover complex user intents that require deductive reasoning based on world knowledge. Meanwhile, LLMs show strong deep reasoning capabilities, but their latency and computational costs remain challenging for industrial applications. More critically, there are performance bottlenecks in multi-scenario scalability: as shown in Figure 1, existing solutions require independent training and deployment for each scenario, leading to low resource utilization and high maintenance costs-a challenge unaddressed in GR literature. To address these, we present OxygenREC, an industrial recommendation system that leverages Fast-Slow Thinking to deliver deep reasoning with strict latency and multi-scenario requirements of real-world environments. First, we adopt a Fast-Slow Thinking architecture. Slow thinking uses a near-line LLM pipeline to synthesize Contextual Reasoning Instructions, while fast thinking employs a high-efficiency encoder--decoder backbone for real-time generation. Second, to ensure reasoning instructions effectively enhance recommendation generation, we introduce a semantic alignment mechanism with Instruction-Guided Retrieval (IGR) to filter intent-relevant historical behaviors and use a Query-to-Item (Q2I) loss for instruction-item consistency. Finally, to resolve multi-scenario scalability, we transform scenario information into controllable instructions, using unified reward mapping and Soft Adaptive Group Clip Policy Optimization (SA-GCPO) to align policies with diverse business objectives, realizing a train-once-deploy-everywhere paradigm.",

        "title": "LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection for Few-Shot Wearable-Sensor Human Activity Recognition",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection framework to address a key limitation in state-of-the-art Human Activity Recognition (HAR) methods: their reliance on large labeled datasets and purely geometric exemplar selection, which often fail to distinguish similar weara-ble sensor activities such as walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and $k$-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel framework, termed Fourier-Activated Adapter (FAA), for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained language models. By incorporating random Fourier features into lightweight adapter modules, FAA decomposes intermediate representations into complementary low- and high-frequency components, enabling frequency-aware modulation of semantic information. This design allows the model to selectively emphasize informative frequency bands during adaptation while preserving the representational capacity of the frozen backbone. Extensive experiments on GLUE, E2E NLG, and instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FAA consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while maintaining low computational and memory overhead. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of frequency-aware activation and adaptive weighting mechanisms, highlighting FAA as a robust and efficient approach for post-training large language models.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the syntax of qulk-clauses in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic (YIA) within the Minimalist Program. The construction qulk-clause, a morphologically fused form meaning 'I said,' introduces embedded declarative interrogative, and imperative clauses, often eithout complementizer. The central proposal of this paper is that qulk-clauses are biclausal structures in which qulk functions a clause-embedding predicate sec;ecting a dull CP complement. By applying core minimalist operations, viz., Merge, Move, Agree, and Spell-out, the study provides a layered syntactic analysis of qulk-clauses, for illustrating how their derivation proceeds through standard computational steps and post-syntactic processes such as Morphological Merger. The proposal also accounts for dialect-specific features like bipartite negation, cliticization, and CP embedding. The findings offer theoretical contributions to generative syntax, specifically minimalism. The study concludes raising theoretical questions concerning extending the analysis to the addressee-clause kil-k 'you said'. It also provides insights into the possibility of the universality of minimalism.",
