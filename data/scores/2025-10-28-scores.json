        "abstract": "Multilingual e-commerce search is challenging due to linguistic diversity and\nthe noise inherent in user-generated queries. This paper documents the solution\nemployed by our team (EAR-MP) for the CIKM 2025 AnalytiCup, which addresses two\ncore tasks: Query-Category (QC) relevance and Query-Item (QI) relevance. Our\napproach first normalizes the multilingual dataset by translating all text into\nEnglish, then mitigates noise through extensive data cleaning and\nnormalization. For model training, we build on DeBERTa-v3-large and improve\nperformance with label smoothing, self-distillation, and dropout. In addition,\nwe introduce task-specific upgrades, including hierarchical token injection for\nQC and a hybrid scoring mechanism for QI. Under constrained compute, our method\nachieves competitive results, attaining an F1 score of 0.8796 on QC and 0.8744\non QI. These findings underscore the importance of systematic data\npreprocessing and tailored training strategies for building robust,\nresource-efficient multilingual relevance systems.",

While approaches like\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to\nmitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval\nstrategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,\nknowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose\nTagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy\nthat boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and\naltering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our\nhypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant\nquestion-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging\nthe context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to\nconsistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token\ncontexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop\nqueries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text.

However, most\nLLM judges operate solely on intrinsic text-based reasoning, limiting their\nability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation.\nMotivated by the success of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in numerous tasks,\nwe propose TIR-Judge, an end-to-end RL framework for training LLM judges that\nintegrates a code executor for precise evaluation. TIR-Judge is built on three\nprinciples: (i) diverse training across verifiable and non-verifiable domains,\n(ii) flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and (iii)\niterative RL that bootstraps directly from the initial model without\ndistillation. On seven public benchmarks, TIR-Judge surpasses strong\nreasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), and\nachieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 despite having only\n8B parameters. Remarkably, TIR-Judge-Zero - trained entirely without distilled\njudge trajectories, matches the performance of distilled variants,\ndemonstrating that tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative\nreinforcement learning.",

        "abstract": "Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative\ncontent, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought\nthrough repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for\nevaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks\nsuch as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a\nsingle model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,\nreal-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible\nanswers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive\ntaxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to\nLMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that\nfurther breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a\nlarge-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial\nHivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)\nintra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar\nresponses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models\nproduce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human\nannotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25\nindependent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and\nindividual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our\nfindings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated\nto human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic\nannotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall,\nINFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically\nstudying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to\nguide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the\nArtificial Hivemind.",

Among\nthese, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to\nidentify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting\nprecise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting\nexample-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images\n(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of\ncapturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To\novercome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that\nunifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide\nembeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a\ncorpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained\nmorphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and\nflexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)\nmosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide\nresearch; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly\nretrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public\npathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including\nanatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,\nand grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and\nstomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional\nimage-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further\ndemonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,\nand enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical\nscenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable\nretrieval solution for digital pathology.",

Unlike prior resources that mostly rely on semantically\ndisconnected utterances and implausible temporal gaps, LibriConvo ensures\nsemantic coherence and realistic conversational timing. Our pipeline leverages\nCallHome with external VAD for reliable boundaries, applies compression to\nreduce unnaturally long silences, and organizes LibriTTS utterances by book to\nmaintain contextual consistency. Acoustic realism is enhanced via a novel room\nimpulse response selection procedure that ranks speaker-microphone\nconfigurations by spatial plausibility, balancing realism and diversity. The\ndataset comprises 240.1 hours across 1,496 dialogues with 830 unique speakers,\nsplit in a speaker-disjoint manner for robust evaluation. Baselines show that\nthe sortformer model outperforms the pyannote pipeline in diarization, while a\nfine-tuned Fast Conformer-CTC XLarge with Serialized Output Training achieves\n7.29\\% WER for ASR, surpassing zero-shot Whisper-large-v3.

        "abstract": "The core task of recommender systems is to learn user preferences from\nhistorical user-item interactions. With the rapid development of large language\nmodels (LLMs), recent research has explored leveraging the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs to enhance rating prediction tasks. However, existing\ndistillation-based methods suffer from limitations such as the teacher model's\ninsufficient recommendation capability, costly and static supervision, and\nsuperficial transfer of reasoning ability. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes RecZero, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based recommendation paradigm\nthat abandons the traditional multi-model and multi-stage distillation\napproach. Instead, RecZero trains a single LLM through pure RL to autonomously\ndevelop reasoning capabilities for rating prediction. RecZero consists of two\nkey components: (1) \"Think-before-Recommendation\" prompt construction, which\nemploys a structured reasoning template to guide the model in step-wise\nanalysis of user interests, item features, and user-item compatibility; and (2)\nrule-based reward modeling, which adopts group relative policy optimization\n(GRPO) to compute rewards for reasoning trajectories and optimize the LLM.\nAdditionally, the paper explores a hybrid paradigm, RecOne, which combines\nsupervised fine-tuning with RL, initializing the model with cold-start\nreasoning samples and further optimizing it with RL. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that RecZero and RecOne significantly outperform existing baseline\nmethods on multiple benchmark datasets, validating the superiority of the RL\nparadigm in achieving autonomous reasoning-enhanced recommender systems.",

To address this, we\nintroduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting\nanswers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we\npropose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized\nQuestion Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized\nintents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer\nselection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting\ntheir acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains\nthrough systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality\ncontrol combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental\nevaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems\nstruggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts.

To\naddress this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which\nenables attention heads to \"knock\" on each other - facilitating cross-head\nfeature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention.

KHA adds only minimal parameters and\nFLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention\nvariants.

This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as\nabstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes\ninto finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This\nrecursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,\nenabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.\nFurthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,\nmulti-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical\ndecision-making processes.

This\nvisual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content\ngeneration and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,\nprogress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,\na bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To\naddress these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling\nperspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages\nreciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a\nlarge-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex\ninteractive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we\nconstruct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This\npowers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish\na visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,\nvisual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from\nexisting approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive\nexperiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate\nthe superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale\nmodels approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.\nFurthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing\nprogrammatic logic with its visual expression.

Using this\ncorpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models\n(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting\nstrategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best\ncompared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC\nand ECT datasets.

In such cases, to ensure\nthe human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an\nassistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but\nalso estimate how and when this information can be communicated most\neffectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive\nresource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming\ninformation. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which\nmeets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,\nformalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)\nmodelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely\nalignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts\nmessage specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based\non projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence\nattention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several\ntimesteps out to a fixed horizon.

        "abstract": "The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining\nnarrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end\ngeneration approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue\nthis failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two\ndisparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format\nadherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to\nspecialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in\nimplementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We\naddress this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs\nexisting screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages\nthese inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.\nBlind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%\nwin rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of\nhuman-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation\narchitecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in\ncomplex creative domains.",

        "abstract": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method\nwidely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the\nprojection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the\ndimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens\nshare the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This\nlimits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent\nsemantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose\nToken-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts\nLoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise\ninput-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of\nTopLoRA can be expressed as $B\\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank\nmatrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated\nfrom each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA\nweights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA\nweights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments\nacross multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently\noutperforms LoRA and its variants.

However, SMB documents are\noften difficult to parse. They are rarely born digital and instead are\ndistributed as scanned images that are none machine readable. The scans\nthemselves are low in resolution, affected by skew or rotation, and often\ncontain noisy backgrounds. These documents also tend to be heterogeneous,\nmixing narratives, tables, figures, and multilingual content within the same\nreport. Such characteristics pose major challenges for automated information\nextraction, especially when relying on end to end large Vision Language Models,\nwhich are computationally expensive, sensitive to noise, and slow when applied\nto files with hundreds of pages.\n  We propose a multistage pipeline that leverages traditional image processing\nmodels and OCR extraction, together with compact VLMs for structured field\nextraction of large-scale financial documents. Our approach begins with image\npre-processing, including segmentation, orientation detection, and size\nnormalization. Multilingual OCR is then applied to recover page-level text.\nUpon analyzing the text information, pages are retrieved for coherent sections.\nFinally, compact VLMs are operated within these narrowed-down scopes to extract\nstructured financial indicators.\n  Our approach is evaluated using an internal corpus of multi-lingual, scanned\nfinancial documents. The results demonstrate that compact VLMs, together with a\nmultistage pipeline, achieves 8.8 times higher field level accuracy relative to\ndirectly feeding the whole document into large VLMs, only at 0.7 percent of the\nGPU cost and 92.6 percent less end-to-end service latency.",

        "abstract": "Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent\nchallenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,\ngeneral-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic\nclassroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on\nsentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,\ninterpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword\ntokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings\nunder a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our\nresults demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and\neven super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and\nsurpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis\nof annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better\naligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to\nlesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the\nsufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external\nvalidity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added\nmeasures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.\nHowever, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that\nwhile the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full\ngeneralization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for\nAI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable,\nreliable, and valid feedback for educator development.",

        "abstract": "Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to\npropose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending\nthis idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the\nragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of\ndraft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention\nmasks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations\nviolate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative\ndecoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive\ngeneration. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the\nragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization\nrequirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch\nspeculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of\noverhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences\nand dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead\nwhile preserving per-sequence speculative speedups.

We find that retrieval heads are not\nprimarily responsible for avoiding uncertainty. Instead, we identify a small\nset of non-retrieval attention heads that disproportionately attend to\nmisleading tokens in uncertain contexts. Masking these heads yields significant\nimprovements, reducing flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing\nincoherence or overcorrection. However, when tested for downstream tasks, we\nobserve trade-offs with flip behavior.

A key structural feature of\nthese interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes\ninto interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been\nwidely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous\nspoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.\nAt the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating\ndiscourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on\ntracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether\nexplicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in\ngroup talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in\nsynchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting\nstrategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences\nperformance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that\ncapture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.\nOur results show that providing clear conversational thread information\nimproves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of\ndownstream analysis on well-structured dialogue.

We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal\nsplits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using\nmultiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and\nhybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy\nand qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task\nprompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer\nadvantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly\nacross sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting\nand rigorous evaluation protocols.

        "title": "Are ASR foundation models generalized enough to capture features of regional dialects for low-resource languages?",
        "abstract": "Conventional research on speech recognition modeling relies on the canonical\nform for most low-resource languages while automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nfor regional dialects is treated as a fine-tuning task. To investigate the\neffects of dialectal variations on ASR we develop a 78-hour annotated Bengali\nSpeech-to-Text (STT) corpus named Ben-10. Investigation from linguistic and\ndata-driven perspectives shows that speech foundation models struggle heavily\nin regional dialect ASR, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We observe\nthat all deep learning methods struggle to model speech data under dialectal\nvariations but dialect specific model training alleviates the issue. Our\ndataset also serves as a out of-distribution (OOD) resource for ASR modeling\nunder constrained resources in ASR algorithms. The dataset and code developed\nfor this project are publicly available",

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are\nincreasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans.\nHowever, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social\ninteractions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built\ndatasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture\nthe authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human\nconversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad\nsocial science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues\ncollected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of\n312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show\nthat SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under\ncomplex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality.\nMoreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the\nperformance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in foundation models have highlighted the significant\nbenefits of multi-stage training, with a particular emphasis on the emergence\nof mid-training as a vital stage that bridges pre-training and post-training.\nMid-training is distinguished by its use of intermediate data and computational\nresources, systematically enhancing specified capabilities such as mathematics,\ncoding, reasoning, and long-context extension, while maintaining foundational\ncompetencies. This survey provides a formal definition of mid-training for\nlarge language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that\nencompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture\noptimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of\nobjective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a\ndistinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities.\nBy clarifying the unique contributions of mid-training, this survey offers a\ncomprehensive taxonomy and actionable insights, supporting future research and\ninnovation in the advancement of LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved\nthe training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in\ngeneration quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research\nfocuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\narchitectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly\nobserved in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize\nimportance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a\nrescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient\nvariance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the\nfinal performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic\ninnovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction\nfor efficient training of large-scale expert models.",
