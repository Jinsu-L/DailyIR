        "title": "DMGIN: How Multimodal LLMs Enhance Large Recommendation Models for Lifelong User Post-click Behaviors",
        "abstract": "Modeling user interest based on lifelong user behavior sequences is crucial\nfor enhancing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. However, long post-click\nbehavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume\nof data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training\nand inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage\napproaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete\nutilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating\nmultimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents\nsignificant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens\nand mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the\nmodel's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest\nNetwork (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences\ncontain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps,\nDMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete\nlifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no\nadditional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing\nmultimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from\ngrouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors\nwithin each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers\nto capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally\nordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive\nexperiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness\nand efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that\nDMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%.",

This\npaper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding\neffects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We\ntheoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,\nshowing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature\ndistributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also\ninvestigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that\nthey introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior.

        "abstract": "Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each\ncharacter and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character\nsegmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in\nsequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first\ndetecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly\noutput full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of\nlanguage models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe\nthat the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word\nsegmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical\nprogression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to\nbypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for\nbetter utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not\nonly improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough\nliterature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark\nsuch shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a\nmeticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level\nannotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy\nimprovement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning\ntowards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4\ntimes improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines.

We validated this functionality using a proprietary Japanese\nnews dataset from Nikkei News, a leading Japanese media corporation renowned\nfor its comprehensive coverage of business, economic, and financial news.\nNewsReX makes reproducing complex experiments faster and more accessible to a\nwider range of hardware making sure the speed up it also achieved for less\npowerful GPUs, like an 8GB RTX 3060 Ti. Beyond the library, this paper offers\nan analysis of key training parameters often overlooked in the literature,\nincluding the effect of different negative sampling strategies, the varying\nnumber of epochs, the impact of random batching, and more. This supplementary\nanalysis serves as a valuable reference for future research, aiming to reduce\nredundant computation when comparing baselines and guide best practices.

Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied\nto mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly\neffective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness.

In this work, we\npropose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes\ndiversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise\ndiversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize\nthem into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then\nexplores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,\neach representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is\nidentified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection\nprocess incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's\nperformance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing\ncapabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread\nuse. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but\ncurrent methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper\nexplores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement\nLearning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a\n7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first\nstrategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a\nnovel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The\nsecond, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose\nreward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a\nreflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive\nexperiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative\noutput over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields\nsuperior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in\ntraining efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting\na more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated\nevaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments.

However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods\nare mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to\ncomprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing\nto directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate\nprediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle\ncommonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to\nconsider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex\ninteractions between modalities.\n  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based\nMulti-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through\nprediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal\nFeature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,\nand the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC\nModule extract synergistic, common, and special information among different\nmodalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,\nimproving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among\ndifferent features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the\nFDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise.

Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple\nprompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent\nunderlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of \"ideological depth\"\nin LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political\nrepresentations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the\n\"steerability\" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting\nand activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch\nbetween liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an\nincreased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.\nSecond, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse\nAutoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower\nsteerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our\nevaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than\nanother model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core\npolitical feature in an ideologically \"deep\" model, leading to consistent,\nlogical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same\nintervention in a \"shallow\" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.\nOur findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs\nand that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political\narchitecture.",

Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset\nspanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026\nexpert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality\nevaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and\nmedical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs\nwith expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate\nsubstantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.",

        "title": "Normality and the Turing Test",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of\nnormality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.",

In this paper, we conduct the\nfirst study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested\nas shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer\ntokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,\nwe propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation\nthrough selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the\nmodel, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP\nconsistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds\npromise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments\nshow that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC\nperformance.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human\nlanguage acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP\neffects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with\ndelayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)\nwith delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects\nusing textual language models, their presence in speech models remains\nunderexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language\nacquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training\noffsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination\nperformance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP\neffects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2\nexposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset\nleads to L1 forgetting.",

In Study 1, a\nseven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents,\nteachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map\nchildren's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others,\nfunctional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform\nconversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery,\nEntertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support.\nIn Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges,\ncomparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an\nunstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question\ncount/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach.\nBuilding on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded\nconversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and\ncaregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application\nwith Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows,\nand an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective,\nscaffolded learning.",

To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification\nframework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning\nwith Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B\nlanguage model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system\ntailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation\nto overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized\nmodel achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact\nmatch accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy\nof 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art\nLLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key\nmetrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS\nclassification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the\nadvanced reasoning capabilities of language models.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language\nmodels (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of\nremarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,\nexhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For\nexample, notable claims include that a single training example can match the\nperformance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not\nneed to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can\nmatch or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise\nconditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they\nfail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that\ndifferentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits\nstrong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated\ntask. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of\ncounterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across\ndifferent model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while\nstandard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these\ncounterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit\nstrong model-task alignment.

This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn\nconversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.\nOur approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large\nLanguage Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that\nmaximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given\nthe responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a\nprincipled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief\ndistribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its\nconstruction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific\ninnovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely\nrelying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a\ntargeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM\nachieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on\nthe 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,\ncompared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.",

        "title": "Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?",
        "abstract": "The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have\ngarnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers\nlike coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have\nbeen done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over\nuncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To\naddress this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a\ntotal of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each\ntesting a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed\ndatasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test\nthe perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large\nReasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their\nperformance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,\nour experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with\nincreasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the\nperformances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in\naccuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some\nskills to be more difficult than others.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,\naffecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates\nthe anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we\ninstructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated\nnegotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.\nExperimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like\nhumans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring\neffect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that\nreasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the\nlong chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant\ncorrelation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring\neffect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases\nin LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in\nsociety.",
