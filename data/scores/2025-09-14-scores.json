        "abstract": "The growing complexity and volume of climate science literature make it\nincreasingly difficult for researchers to find relevant information across\nmodels, datasets, regions, and variables. This paper introduces a\ndomain-specific Knowledge Graph (KG) built from climate publications and\nbroader scientific texts, aimed at improving how climate knowledge is accessed\nand used. Unlike keyword based search, our KG supports structured, semantic\nqueries that help researchers discover precise connections such as which models\nhave been validated in specific regions or which datasets are commonly used\nwith certain teleconnection patterns. We demonstrate how the KG answers such\nquestions using Cypher queries, and outline its integration with large language\nmodels in RAG systems to improve transparency and reliability in\nclimate-related question answering. This work moves beyond KG construction to\nshow its real world value for climate researchers, model developers, and others\nwho rely on accurate, contextual scientific information.",

        "abstract": "Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful way to improve large\nlanguage model (LLM) performance by generating multiple candidate responses and\nselecting among them. However, existing work on dynamic allocation for\ntest-time compute typically considers only parallel generation methods such as\nbest-of-N, overlooking incremental decoding methods like beam search, and has\nlargely ignored latency, focusing only on token usage. We formulate\ninference-time scaling as a problem of dynamic compute allocation and method\nselection, where the system must decide which strategy to apply and how much\ncompute to allocate on a per-query basis. Our framework explicitly incorporates\nboth token cost and wall-clock latency, the latter being critical for user\nexperience and particularly for agentic workflows where models must issue\nmultiple queries efficiently. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that our\napproach consistently outperforms static strategies, achieving favorable\naccuracy-cost trade-offs while remaining practical for deployment.",

We show that there is\nsignificant leakage to the cross channel in areas where only the primary\nspeaker is active. At the same time, the results demonstrate that this does not\naffect the final performance much as these leaked parts are largely ignored by\nthe voice activity detection (VAD). Furthermore, different segmentations are\ncompared showing that advanced diarization approaches are able to reduce the\ngap to oracle segmentation by a third compared to a simple energy-based VAD. We\nadditionally reveal what factors contribute to the remaining difference.

Existing methods often lack the ability to provide\naccurate, real-time medical advice, particularly for irregular inputs and\nunderrepresented languages. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes\nan approach that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) for Arabic medical\ntext generation. The system is designed to assist patients by providing\naccurate medical advice, diagnoses, drug recommendations, and treatment plans\nbased on user input. The research methodology required the collection of a\nunique dataset from social media platforms, capturing real-world medical\nconversations between patients and doctors. The dataset, which includes patient\ncomplaints together with medical advice, was properly cleaned and preprocessed\nto account for multiple Arabic dialects. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art\ngenerative models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2\nMedium, optimized the system's ability to generate reliable medical text.\nResults from evaluations indicate that the fine-tuned Mistral-7B model\noutperformed the other models, achieving average BERT (Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers) Score values in precision, recall, and\nF1-scores of 68.5\\%, 69.08\\%, and 68.5\\%, respectively. Comparative\nbenchmarking and qualitative assessments validate the system's ability to\nproduce coherent and relevant medical replies to informal input.

However, concerns have been raised about applying\nthese human-designed questionnaires to LLMs. One such concern is their lack of\necological validity--the extent to which survey questions adequately reflect\nand resemble real-world contexts in which LLMs generate texts in response to\nuser queries. However, it remains unclear how established questionnaires and\necologically valid questionnaires differ in their outcomes, and what insights\nthese differences may provide. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive\ncomparative analysis of the two types of questionnaires. Our analysis reveals\nthat established questionnaires (1) yield substantially different profiles of\nLLMs from ecologically valid ones, deviating from the psychological\ncharacteristics expressed in the context of user queries, (2) suffer from\ninsufficient items for stable measurement, (3) create misleading impressions\nthat LLMs possess stable constructs, and (4) yield exaggerated profiles for\npersona-prompted LLMs. Overall, our work cautions against the use of\nestablished psychological questionnaires for LLMs. Our code will be released\nupon publication.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled human-like\nsocial simulations at unprecedented scale and fidelity, offering new\nopportunities for computational social science. A key challenge, however, is\nthe construction of persona sets that authentically represent the diversity and\ndistribution of real-world populations. Most existing LLM-based social\nsimulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and\nsimulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona\ngeneration and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona\nsets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing\nhigh-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation.\nOur approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from\nlong-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter\nout low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global\nalignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five\npersonality traits. To address the needs of specific simulation contexts, we\nfurther introduce a task-specific module that adapts the globally aligned\npersona set to targeted subpopulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour method significantly reduces population-level bias and enables accurate,\nflexible social simulation for a wide range of research and policy\napplications.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework for modeling multimodal conversational turn\norganization via the proposition of correlations between language and\ninteractive gestures, based on analysis as to how pragmatic frames are\nconceptualized and evoked by communicators. As a means to provide evidence for\nthe analysis, we developed an annotation methodology to enrich a multimodal\ndataset (annotated for semantic frames) with pragmatic frames modeling\nconversational turn organization. Although conversational turn organization has\nbeen studied by researchers from diverse fields, the specific strategies,\nespecially gestures used by communicators, had not yet been encoded in a\ndataset that can be used for machine learning. To fill this gap, we enriched\nthe Frame2 dataset with annotations of gestures used for turn organization. The\nFrame2 dataset features 10 episodes from the Brazilian TV series Pedro Pelo\nMundo annotated for semantic frames evoked in both video and text. This dataset\nallowed us to closely observe how communicators use interactive gestures\noutside a laboratory, in settings, to our knowledge, not previously recorded in\nrelated literature. Our results have confirmed that communicators involved in\nface-to-face conversation make use of gestures as a tool for passing, taking\nand keeping conversational turns, and also revealed variations of some gestures\nthat had not been documented before. We propose that the use of these gestures\narises from the conceptualization of pragmatic frames, involving mental spaces,\nblending and conceptual metaphors. In addition, our data demonstrate that the\nannotation of pragmatic frames contributes to a deeper understanding of human\ncognition and language.",

        "abstract": "The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to specialized reasoning tasks\nis fundamentally constrained by computational resources. Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a powerful solution, yet the\nlandscape of these techniques is diverse, with distinct methods operating in\neither the model's weight space or its representation space. This paper\ninvestigates the hypothesis that a synergistic combination of these paradigms\ncan unlock superior performance and efficiency. We introduce HEFT (Hierarchical\nEfficient Fine-Tuning), a novel hierarchical adaptation strategy that composes\ntwo distinct PEFT methods in a coarse-to-fine manner: first, a broad,\nfoundational adaptation in the weight space using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),\nfollowed by a precise, surgical refinement of internal activations using\nRepresentation Fine-Tuning (ReFT). We evaluate this approach by fine-tuning a\nLlama-2-7B model on the BoolQ benchmark, a challenging dataset for inferential\nreasoning. Our results reveal a profound synergistic effect. A model fine-tuned\nfor only three epochs with our HEFT strategy achieves an accuracy of 85.17\\%,\nexceeding the performance of models trained for 20 epochs with either LoRA-only\n(85.05\\%) or ReFT-only (83.36\\%) methodologies. This work demonstrates that the\nthoughtful composition of PEFT methods is a potent algorithmic innovation,\noffering a more efficient and effective path toward advancing the reasoning\ncapabilities of language models. By achieving superior results with a fraction\nof the computational budget, our findings present a principled approach to\novercoming the obstacles inherent in adapting large-scale models for complex\ncognitive tasks.",

        "abstract": "Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step\nwhere a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current\nmethods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs,\nleading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\\%), which renders them\nimpractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental\ninability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if\ncorrecting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To\nbridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P)\nScaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from\npattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly\nguides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process\nwithin a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes\nbehind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective\nintervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and\nverify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach\nleverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a\nrigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the\nWho\\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated\ndataset, A2P achieves 47.46\\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\\times$ improvement\nover the 16.67\\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it\nachieves 29.31\\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\\times$ improvement over the baseline's\n12.07\\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding\nprovides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for\nautomated failure attribution.",

It also has relatively lower\nHumming Loss and higher Jaccard Similarity, making it the winning model in the\nfew-shot setting. We find BERT based supervised classifier having superior\nperformance compared to the best performing few-shot generative LLM. The study\nprovides a framework for small open-source LLMs in detecting complex\nmulti-intent dialogues, enhancing the Natural Language Understanding aspect of\ntask-oriented chatbots.",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised hallucination detection aims to identify hallucinated content\ngenerated by large language models (LLMs) without relying on labeled data.\nWhile unsupervised methods have gained popularity by eliminating\nlabor-intensive human annotations, they frequently rely on proxy signals\nunrelated to factual correctness. This misalignment biases detection probes\ntoward superficial or non-truth-related aspects, limiting generalizability\nacross datasets and scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IRIS,\nan unsupervised hallucination detection framework, leveraging internal\nrepresentations intrinsic to factual correctness. IRIS prompts the LLM to\ncarefully verify the truthfulness of a given statement, and obtain its\ncontextualized embedding as informative features for training. Meanwhile, the\nuncertainty of each response is considered a soft pseudolabel for truthfulness.\nExperimental results demonstrate that IRIS consistently outperforms existing\nunsupervised methods. Our approach is fully unsupervised, computationally low\ncost, and works well even with few training data, making it suitable for\nreal-time detection.",

We evaluate the\nreliability of LLM-generated synthetic survey responses against ground-truth\nhuman responses from a Chilean public opinion probabilistic survey.\nSpecifically, we benchmark 128 prompt-model-question triplets, generating\n189,696 synthetic profiles, and pool performance metrics (i.e., accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1-score) in a meta-analysis across 128\nquestion-subsample pairs to test for biases along key sociodemographic\ndimensions.

First,\nsynthetic responses achieve excellent performance on trust items (F1-score and\naccuracy > 0.90). Second, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini and Llama 4 Maverick perform\ncomparably on this task. Third, synthetic-human alignment is highest among\nrespondents aged 45-59.
