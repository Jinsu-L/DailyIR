        "title": "Language Models Improve When Pretraining Data Matches Target Tasks",
        "abstract": "Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these\ntargets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers\ndevelop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then\nrefine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make\nthis optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a\nsample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by\nsimilarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these\nscores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over\n500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to\nthem. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation\nbenchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline\n(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks\nacross all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of\nbenchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms\nbaselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models\nrequire less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly\nmatching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities\nand highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.",

Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models\n(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical\nstructure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL\ndivergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to\nineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling\nhyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced\nWasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior\ndistribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical\nSliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with\nthe prior.

First, we find that a simple\nlinear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all\ntext-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or\nunsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,\nwhile model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive\nsignal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning\ncompletes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT\nsegments.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative\ncapabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,\nand challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative\nevaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness\n(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.\nThese results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,\ncomprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks.

Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle\nin the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial\nnumber of documents as search space. Late interaction mechanism over visual\nlanguage models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based\nvision augmented Q&A tasks. There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based\nmulti-modal Q&A. Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do\nnot support native multi-vector retrieval. Secondly, late interaction requires\ncomputation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption.\nLastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the\napproximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval\nprocess.

In the realm\nof Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like\nRegister-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,\ndespite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a\ndearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware\ndescription languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization\nusing various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,\nan in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally\nequivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these\nmodels across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their\nsuitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose\nChain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of\nLLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves\ngenerating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem\nstatement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These\nsteps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or\ncode) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the\nstandard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets.

        "abstract": "Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing\n(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation\nidentification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant\nadvances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the\nabsence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the\nexisting anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and\ndevelopment of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive\nempirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,\nleveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide\narray of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of\nembedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language\nmodels (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI\n(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,\nscientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).\nOur experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality\nsignificantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based\napproaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow\nalgorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived\nembeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in\ncross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid\nmodel evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical\napplications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes\nall embeddings from different models and code at\nhttps://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work\nprovides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly\ndetection systems.",

To address\nthis issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family,\nspecifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in\nRussian.

Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that\noutlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these\ntasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct\nMERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming\nenvironments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system.

        "abstract": "Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday\nexperience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries\nonline, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of\nbuilding a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social\nmedia. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several\nperspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the\ncontent creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating\nthe repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern\nacross all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes\nplace when recommender systems are almost \"too good\", making recommendations so\ntailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of\nopinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's\nperspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's\nperspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of\npotential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are\nfar-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political\ndecisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation\nof filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape?\nApproaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to\nrepresent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through\nthe lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation\nframework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and\nthe broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of\nview.",

We call our approach\nMathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students\nstruggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects\ndespite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal\nprocessing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal\npedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)\nmethod to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after\nrandomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.\nSamples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade\nSchool Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)\ndatasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a\nmanageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were\nused to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer\n4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for\ncapability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the\nMEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even\nmuch better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH\ndataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.",

The first part examines the\nproperties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,\nemphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It\nproposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including\nregularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to\nstabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second\npart focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency\nby integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,\nguided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents\nsmoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need\nfor labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active\nlearning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and\ncomputational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP\ntasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform\ntraditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The\nthird part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning\nto effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive\nlabeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak\nsupervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by\nleveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training.

Therefore, this study\ninvestigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among\nLLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we\nevaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective\nmodel and prompt design for controlling the values.

The results confirmed that pairs of agents\nwith higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal\ncloseness.

This\ntask, filtered vector search, is challenging as prior state-of-the-art\ngraph-based (unfiltered) similarity search techniques quickly degenerate when\nhard constraints are considered. That is, effective graph-based filtered\nsimilarity search relies on sufficient connectivity for reaching the most\nsimilar items within just a few hops. To consider predicates, recent works\npropose modifying graph traversal to visit only the items that may satisfy\npredicates. However, they fail to offer the just-a-few-hops property for a wide\nrange of predicates: they must restrict predicates significantly or lose\nefficiency if only a small fraction of items satisfy predicates.\n  We propose an opposite approach: instead of constraining traversal, we build\nmany indexes each serving different predicate forms. For effective\nconstruction, we devise a three-dimensional analytical model capturing\nrelationships among index size, search time, and recall, with which we follow a\nworkload-aware approach to pack as many useful indexes as possible into a\ncollection. At query time, the analytical model is employed yet again to\ndiscern the one that offers the fastest search at a given recall. We show\nsuperior performance and support on datasets with varying selectivities and\nforms: our approach achieves up to 8.06x speedup while having as low as 1%\nbuild time versus other indexes, with less than 2.15x memory of a standard HNSW\ngraph and modest knowledge of past workloads.",

        "abstract": "LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand\nharmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our\nfindings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more\nrobust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a\nnew perspective to study AI safety",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language\nModels (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing\non the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and\nreconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and\nPavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between\nmodel-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic\nInterpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship\nbetween attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing\nhypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the\ndomain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that\nattention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression\nrather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can\nalso inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior\nis domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and\ncategory-sensitive patterns.",

We implement a\nsimulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of\nbasic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in\nany language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun),\nand the word order of the language, including the ability to generate novel\nsentences, through the exposure to a modest number of grounded sentences in the\nsame language.

        "abstract": "Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and\nmachine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and\nadapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution\noften is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software\ndependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases\nhave demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we\nobserve that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to\nhallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose\na notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and\ncorresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to\nassist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve\nAssisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and\nanalysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct\ninterpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the\ninter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via\ncell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and\noutputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted\nKaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.\nThe LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the\nsyntactic structure of these notebooks.

        "abstract": "Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key\nfor AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.",
