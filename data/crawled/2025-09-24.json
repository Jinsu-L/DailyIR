Unlike existing benchmarks\nwith a generic or global scope, DRISHTIKON offers deep, fine-grained coverage\nacross India's diverse regions, spanning 15 languages, covering all states and\nunion territories, and incorporating over 64,000 aligned text-image pairs. The\ndataset captures rich cultural themes including festivals, attire, cuisines,\nart forms, and historical heritage amongst many more. We evaluate a wide range\nof vision-language models (VLMs), including open-source small and large models,\nproprietary systems, reasoning-specialized VLMs, and Indic-focused models,\nacross zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings. Our results expose key\nlimitations in current models' ability to reason over culturally grounded,\nmultimodal inputs, particularly for low-resource languages and less-documented\ntraditions.

Unfortunately, they have proven\nnotoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the\nrequired perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical\nmethods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still\nlacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs,\nextracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying\nfeatures. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g.\nsweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding\nprototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the\nLLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space\ndimensions.

        "abstract": "The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational\nresources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains\nconventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling\nbehavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In\naddition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries\nof LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.",

However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards\nmake temporal credit assignment extremely challenging. Recent work attempts to\nintegrate process supervision into agent learning but suffers from biased\nannotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained signals or\nfailtures when state overlap is rare. We therefore introduce Online Process\nReward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL\nthat integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relying\non additional rollouts or explicit step labels. In OPRL, we optimize an\nimplicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy to\ntransform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through a\ntrajectory-based DPO objective. These step rewards are then used to compute\nstep-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages from\noutcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop.\nTheoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent\nwith trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards,\nproviding bounded gradients to stabilize training. Empirically, we evaluate\nOPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as\nwell as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA.\nCrucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL\nbaselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher\nsample-efficiency and lower variance during training. Further analysis also\ndemonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions,\nunderscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the\nintuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a\nsuperposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results\nhave formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and\ncan solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of\ncontinuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous\nworks either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained\ndiscrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth\ndiscrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few\ntokens.\n  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs\nvia reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete\nCoTs. We use \"soft\" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input\nembedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal,\nenabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning\nbenchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs\nmatch discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing\ngreater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario\nis to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference,\nmeaning the \"soft\" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show\ncontinuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model\non out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.",

However, personalized QA remains relatively underexplored due to\nchallenges such as inferring preferences from long, noisy, and implicit\ncontexts, and generating responses that are simultaneously correct,\ncontextually appropriate, and aligned with user expectations and background\nknowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Pathways of Thoughts (PoT),\nan inference-stage method that applies to any large language model (LLM)\nwithout requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The approach models the reasoning\nof an LLM as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects\namong cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and\nclarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories,\nproducing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT\nthen aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user\npreferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the\ncomplementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA\nbenchmark for personalized QA show that PoT consistently outperforms\ncompetitive baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% relative improvement. Human\nevaluation corroborates these results, with annotators preferring outputs from\nPoT in 66% of cases and reporting ties in only 15% of cases.",

Unfortunately, this requires an\nalignment tool that is not available for all languages. Although this issue has\nbeen addressed by aligning speech and text embeddings using nearest-neighbor\nsimilarity search, it does not lead to accurate alignments. In this work, we\nadapt Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for aligning speech and text embeddings during\ntraining. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in\nbridging the modality gap in E2E-ST. Compared to previous work, our method\nproduces more accurate alignments and achieves comparable E2E-ST results while\nbeing significantly faster.

Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts\nor one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning\nerror diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a\nfailure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured\nreflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,\ncontrollable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise\nreflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and\nthen proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine\nDAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing\nthe stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce\nTool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks\nstructural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result\nconsistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,\nreflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.\nExperiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn\ntool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These\nresults indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly\nimproves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for\nagents to learn from failure.",

In this work, we\nsystematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on\nshort-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves\nshort-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from\nlong-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this\nphenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head\nAttention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both\nindependently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction\nand reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual\nknowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making\nexclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that\nhybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for\nfine-tuning LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Subword tokenizers trained on multilingual corpora naturally produce\noverlapping tokens across languages. Does token overlap facilitate\ncross-lingual transfer or instead introduce interference between languages?\nPrior work offers mixed evidence, partly due to varied setups and confounders,\nsuch as token frequency or subword segmentation granularity. To address this\nquestion, we devise a controlled experiment where we train bilingual\nautoregressive models on multiple language pairs under systematically varied\nvocabulary overlap settings. Crucially, we explore a new dimension to\nunderstanding how overlap affects transfer: the semantic similarity of tokens\nshared across languages. We first analyze our models' hidden representations\nand find that overlap of any kind creates embedding spaces that capture\ncross-lingual semantic relationships, while this effect is much weaker in\nmodels with disjoint vocabularies. On XNLI and XQuAD, we find that models with\noverlap outperform models with disjoint vocabularies, and that transfer\nperformance generally improves as overlap increases. Overall, our findings\nhighlight the advantages of token overlap in multilingual models and show that\nsubstantial shared vocabulary remains a beneficial design choice for\nmultilingual tokenizers.",

Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing\nmethods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global\ntemporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts\nand the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying\nLLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic\nProcessing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to\nefficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a\nnode-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism\nto efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture\nglobal semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored\nprompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly,\nwe intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as\nthe dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers.\nExtensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority,\nachieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task.\nBesides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs\nand LLMs.",

Although this two-stage retrieval-ranking\nframework demonstrates practical effectiveness, the significance of retriever\nscores from the previous stage has been limitedly explored, which is\ninformative. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the limitations of\nusing retriever scores as the rerankers' input directly and argue that the\nreranking task is essentially a noise reduction problem from the retriever\nscores. Following this notion, we derive an adversarial framework, DNR, that\nassociates the denoising reranker with a carefully designed noise generation\nmodule. We extend the conventional score error minimization term with three\naugmented objectives, including: 1) a denoising objective that aims to denoise\nthe noisy retriever scores to align with the user feedback; 2) an adversarial\nretriever score generation objective that improves the exploration in the\nretriever score space; and 3) a distribution regularization term that aims to\nalign the distribution of generated noisy retriever scores with the real ones.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, together with\nanalytical support, validating the effectiveness of the proposed DNR.",

Our research examines how\ninstruction-following capabilities in LLMs interact with multi-document\ncomparison tasks, identifying what we term the \"Ranking Blind Spot\", a\ncharacteristic of LLM decision processes during comparative evaluation. We\nanalyze how this ranking blind spot affects LLM evaluation systems through two\napproaches: Decision Objective Hijacking, which alters the evaluation goal in\npairwise ranking systems, and Decision Criteria Hijacking, which modifies\nrelevance standards across ranking schemes. These approaches demonstrate how\ncontent providers could potentially influence LLM-based ranking systems to\naffect document positioning. These attacks aim to force the LLM ranker to\nprefer a specific passage and rank it at the top.

To enable more precise failure analysis, we\nintroduce CogniLoad, a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load\nTheory (CLT). CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with\nindependently tunable parameters that reflect CLT's core dimensions: intrinsic\ndifficulty ($d$) controls intrinsic load; distractor-to-signal ratio ($\\rho$)\nregulates extraneous load; and task length ($N$) serves as an operational proxy\nfor conditions demanding germane load. Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs,\nCogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length\nas a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic\ncomplexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. By offering systematic,\nfactorial control over these cognitive load dimensions, CogniLoad provides a\nreproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM\nreasoning limitations and guiding future model development.",

This\nstudy aimed to develop an automated approach to measure SDM by using language\nmodelling and the conversational alignment (CA) score. A total of 157\nvideo-recorded patient-doctor conversations from a randomized multi-centre\ntrial evaluating SDM decision aids for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillations\nwere transcribed and segmented into 42,559 sentences. Context-response pairs\nand negative sampling were employed to train deep learning (DL) models and\nfine-tuned BERT models via the next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Each\ntop-performing model was used to calculate four types of CA scores. A\nrandom-effects analysis by clinician, adjusting for age, sex, race, and trial\narm, assessed the association between CA scores and SDM outcomes: the\nDecisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and the Observing Patient Involvement in\nDecision-Making 12 (OPTION12) scores. p-values were corrected for multiple\ncomparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Among 157 patients (34% female,\nmean age 70 SD 10.8), clinicians on average spoke more words than patients\n(1911 vs 773). The DL model without the stylebook strategy achieved a recall@1\nof 0.227, while the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) achieved the highest recall@1\nwith 0.640. The AbsMax (18.36 SE7.74 p=0.025) and Max CA (21.02 SE7.63 p=0.012)\nscores generated with the DL without stylebook were associated with OPTION12.\nThe Max CA score generated with the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) was associated\nwith the DCS score (-27.61 SE12.63 p=0.037). BERT model sizes did not have an\nimpact the association between CA scores and SDM.

In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to generate Persian\nliterary text enriched with culturally relevant expressions. We build a dataset\nof user-generated Persian literary spanning 20 diverse topics and assess model\noutputs along four creativity dimensions-originality, fluency, flexibility, and\nelaboration-by adapting the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. To reduce\nevaluation costs, we adopt an LLM as a judge for automated scoring and validate\nits reliability against human judgments using intraclass correlation\ncoefficients, observing strong agreement.

We present NormGenesis, a multicultural framework for\ngenerating and annotating socially grounded dialogues across English, Chinese,\nand Korean. To model the dynamics of social interaction beyond static norm\nclassification, we propose a novel dialogue type, Violation-to-Resolution\n(V2R), which models the progression of conversations following norm violations\nthrough recognition and socially appropriate repair. To improve pragmatic\nconsistency in underrepresented languages, we implement an exemplar-based\niterative refinement early in the dialogue synthesis process.

Using this framework, we construct a\ndataset of 10,800 multi-turn dialogues annotated at the turn level for norm\nadherence, speaker intent, and emotional response. Human and LLM-based\nevaluations demonstrate that NormGenesis significantly outperforms existing\ndatasets in refinement quality, dialogue naturalness, and generalization\nperformance. We show that models trained on our V2R-augmented data exhibit\nimproved pragmatic competence in ethically sensitive contexts.

        "abstract": "The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment\non memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter\noffloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can\ndegrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow\ninference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate\nparameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft\ntokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single\nforward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward\npasses that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on\npretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align\nwith custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model\ntraining usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from\ninsufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token\nacceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,\nwe propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading\nthat is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft\nmodel by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target\nLLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers\nand the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment.\nSubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for\nQwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for\nQwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).",

Knowledge graphs (KGs), such as\nthe Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), offer structured biomedical\nknowledge that can support trustworthy reasoning. Prior approaches typically\nintegrate KGs via retrieval augmented generation or fine tuning, inserting KG\ncontent into prompts rather than enabling structured reasoning. We explore an\nalternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths,\nwhere the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct\ndiagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work\nthat leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and\ngrounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is\noften easier than generating one from scratch. It also parallels physicians'\ndiagnostic assessment, where they judge which sequences of findings and\nintermediate conditions most plausibly support a diagnosis. We first\nsystematically evaluate five task formulation for knowledge path judging and\neight training paradigm. Second, we test whether the path judging abilities\ngeneralize to downstream diagnostic tasks, including diagnosis summarization\nand medical question answering. Experiments with three open source\ninstruct-tuned LLMs reveal both promise and brittleness: while specific reward\noptimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, the\ntransferability to downstream tasks remain weak.
