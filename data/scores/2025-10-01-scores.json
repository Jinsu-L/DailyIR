        "abstract": "LLM-based relevance judgment generation has become a crucial approach in\nadvancing evaluation methodologies in Information Retrieval (IR). It has\nprogressed significantly, often showing high correlation with human judgments\nas reflected in LLMJudge leaderboards \\cite{rahmani2025judging}. However,\nexisting methods for relevance judgments, rely heavily on sensitive prompting\nstrategies, lacking standardized workflows for generating reliable labels. To\nfill this gap, we reintroduce our method, \\textit{Task-aware Rubric-based\nEvaluation} (TRUE), for relevance judgment generation. Originally developed for\nusefulness evaluation in search sessions, we extend TRUE to mitigate the gap in\nrelevance judgment due to its demonstrated effectiveness and reproducible\nworkflow. This framework leverages iterative data sampling and reasoning to\nevaluate relevance judgments across multiple factors including intent,\ncoverage, specificity, accuracy and usefulness. In this paper, we evaluate TRUE\non the TREC DL 2019, 2020 and LLMJudge datasets and our results show that TRUE\nachieves strong performance on the system-ranking LLM leaderboards. The primary\nfocus of this work is to provide a reproducible framework for LLM-based\nrelevance judgments, and we further analyze the effectiveness of TRUE across\nmultiple dimensions.",

Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which\nrequire no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet\naccurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present\nSQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic\nQuery-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from\na vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the\ntarget image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the\nquery to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.\nIn the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are\npresented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint\nvisual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy\noperates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings.

        "abstract": "Modeling sequential user behaviors for future behavior prediction is crucial\nin improving user's information retrieval experience. Recent studies highlight\nthe importance of incorporating contextual information to enhance prediction\nperformance. One crucial but usually neglected contextual information is the\nscene feature which we define as sub-interfaces within an app, created by\ndevelopers to provide specific functionalities, such as ``text2product search\"\nand ``live\" modules in e-commence apps. Different scenes exhibit distinct\nfunctionalities and usage habits, leading to significant distribution gap in\nuser engagement across them. Popular sequential behavior models either ignore\nthe scene feature or merely use it as attribute embeddings, which cannot\neffectively capture the dynamic interests and interplay between scenes and\nitems when modeling user sequences. In this work, we propose a novel Dual\nSequence Prediction networks (DSPnet) to effectively capture the dynamic\ninterests and interplay between scenes and items for future behavior\nprediction. DSPnet consists of two parallel networks dedicated to learn users'\ndynamic interests over items and scenes, and a sequence feature enhancement\nmodule to capture the interplay for enhanced future behavior prediction.\nFurther, we introduce a Conditional Contrastive Regularization (CCR) loss to\ncapture the invariance of similar historical sequences. Theoretical analysis\nsuggests that DSPnet is a principled way to learn the joint relationships\nbetween scene and item sequences. Extensive experiments are conducted on one\npublic benchmark and two collected industrial datasets. The method has been\ndeployed online in our system, bringing a 0.04 point increase in CTR, 0.78\\%\ngrowth in deals, and 0.64\\% rise in GMV.

Multi-layer nested JSON\nstructures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into\nsemantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into\nkey-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual\nrelationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.\nFor instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata\n(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information\n(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a\ntransformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and\noutputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,\ncurrent benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize\npure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction\nabilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining\ntasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring\n2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by\ndifficulty.

While graph-based\nANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by\nthe available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory\nusage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still\nsuffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage\nI/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant\nI/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.\n  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor\nsearch (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN\nintroduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with\nphysical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O\noperations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a\nco-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique\nto store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding\nunnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management\nstrategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data\nallocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency\nand storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving\n1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different\ndatasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Some traits making a \"good\" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For\nexample, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are\nsometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear\nobjective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to\nmeasure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot\nArena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer \"better\"\npersonality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model\nresponses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight\nlimitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was\nrolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed\noverfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,\nlimited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We\nintroduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality\nchanges, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited\nacross AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI\nannotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and\nbrowser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we\nanalyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets\nincluding Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to\nanalyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our\nFeedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in\npopular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation\ndata at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.",

Augmenting LLMs with\nexternal search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents\nto a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query\nformulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify\nerrors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental\ncomplexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective\napproach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher\nexplicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on\nwhether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of\ngoal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist\nspurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.\nExtensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and\nachieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate\nsubstantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the\nfragility of the search process.

To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a\nreasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents\nthe following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond\nshallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,\nand causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural\nimages, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across\ncontent types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple\nimages and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting\nreal-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived\neither from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of\npublic datasets.

        "abstract": "Recommenders aim to rank items from a discrete item corpus in line with user\ninterests, yet suffer from extremely sparse user preference data. Recent\nadvances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which\nalleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the\ncollapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current\ndiffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise,\nwhich is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference\ndata in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in\ndiscrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based\nrecommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user\npreferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing\ndiffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of\npreference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item\npairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex.\nThis formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature\nof recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of\ninjecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the\npreferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling --\nthereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference\nreconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by\niteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios.\nPreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical\nguarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent\nperformance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across\nfive benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and\nempirical effectiveness.",

To this\nend, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec,\nthat corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by\ndifferential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically\nsuppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through\nlayer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions\nthrough adaptive cross-layer feature fusion.

However, when applied to more complex\ntasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges\ndue to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous\nnature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate\ncorrectness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend\nbeyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of\nboth external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on\nimproving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting\ndocuments, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and\ndiminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose\nthe Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level\nthinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.\nGiven a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the\nfaithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then\napplies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring\nreward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness\nevaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both\nexternal and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that\nTRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and\nincorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both\nanswer correctness and usefulness.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but\ncontinue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack\nvectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable\nto fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive\ndemographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect\noutcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible\nyet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a\nstrategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text\ngeneration. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the\nretrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts\nfairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled\ndemographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis\nperformed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace\n(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),\neach integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic\nvariations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed\nanalysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with\nperturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the\nviolations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work\nreinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to\nprevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for\ndevelopers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs\nwithout compromising fairness or reliability.",

However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE\nmodels from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the\nnumber of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit\nprecipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE\n(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly\ninto the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated\nexperts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:\ntop-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained\ncapabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.\nWe explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise\nrandomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that\na single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at\nvarious expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist\nmodels, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not\nonly unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by\nallocating different computational budgets to different model layers.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to\nevaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative\nwriting. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality\nand explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that\ncurrent LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in\nthe prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for\nlong-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative\nwriting. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must\nchoose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100\npairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and\nGemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,\nwe assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source\nidentity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal\norigin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.\nResults reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency\nbias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear\nprovenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are\nespecially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended\nLitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost\nnever reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of\ncontent qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge\nsystems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as\nevaluators in both research and deployment.",

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on\nfactoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and\nuntruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their\nparametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --\nmodels must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid\nhallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:\napproaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those\nthat encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct\nanswers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we\npresent TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly\noptimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using\nGRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct\nanswers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce\nhallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling\nabstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive\nexperiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to\nvanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves\ntruthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models\n(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth\nablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as\nsupervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual\ncorrectness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven\nTruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,\nunderscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing\ntruthful LLMs.",

It draws on information from all\nsegments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses\nsegment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment\nscore comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks\nsentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than\nprevious work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random\nnoise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to\nextreme outliers.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.\nThey can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are\ncrucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require\ndetailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.\nHowever, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging\ntask of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to\nimprove trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a\nvital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval\nsource to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,\nexisting RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific\nsimulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve\nfrom scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form\nanswers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG\nframework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering\nclimate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations\nand human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator\nretrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We\nfurther design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty\nestimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently\nverify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG\noutperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in\nfactuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level\ngeneration.",

        "abstract": "Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a\ntarget set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make\ntradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value\nconflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an\nautomatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a\nuser-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in\nwhich a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the\nset. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written \"user prompt\" and\nevaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the\nvalue set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended\nevaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,\nsuch as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user\nautonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including\ndetailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a\ntarget ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate\nsuccess at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict.

Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for\nmodel failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model\niteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The\nLLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its\ngeneration of difficult examples.

To address these questions, we present the CritPt\n(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced\n\"critical point\"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,\nresearch-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research\nareas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical\nphysics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical\nphysics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.\nCritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate\nfull-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to\n190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are\nnewly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.\nEvery problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable\nanswer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for\nadvanced physics-specific output formats.

        "title": "Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models",
        "abstract": "A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological\norganisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to provide personalized\nrecommendations through multi-turn natural language interactions with users.\nGiven the strong interaction and reasoning skills of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), leveraging LLMs for CRSs has recently emerged as a promising direction.\nHowever, existing LLM-based methods often lack explicit optimization of\ninteraction strategies, instead relying on unified prompts and the LLM's\ninternal knowledge to decide how to interact, which can lead to suboptimal\noutcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforced Strategy Optimization\n(RSO) method for CRS, which decomposes the process of generating\nstrategy-driven response decisions into the macro-level strategy planning and\nmicro-level strategy adaptation through a network-of-experts architecture. At\nthe macro level, a Planner expert selects macro-level interaction strategies\n(e.g., recommend, explain, encourage). At the micro level, an Actor expert\ngenerates detailed responses conditioned on the selected macro-level strategy,\nguided by auxiliary experts that provide complementary information such as user\npreferences and factual grounding. This hierarchical decomposition disentangles\nthe optimization of different sub-tasks involved in CRS response generation,\nenabling more tractable learning at each level. To address the scarcity of\nhigh-quality multi-turn training data, we formulate strategy learning as a\nreinforcement learning problem, guided by an LLM-based reward model to achieve\nautomatic strategy exploration. Extensive experiments show that RSO\nsignificantly improves interaction performance compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit hierarchical strategy\noptimization for CRS.",

        "abstract": "Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great\npotential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable\nworkflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually\ndesigned processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.\nWhile a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied\nto specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate\nfeedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their\noperations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these\nlimitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that\nadaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task\nrequirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an\nexecutor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals\ndefined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on\nintermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the\nexecutor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with\ncontext-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded\nreasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including\nsocial reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code\ngeneration. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing\nbaselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust\ngeneralization across diverse domains.

To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which\nretrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead\nof using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of\ngrammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to\nimprove the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets\nand create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is\nnot only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future\nstudies in both CGEC and GEE.

However, prior work has found that explanations can\neasily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy\nundesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two\ncomplementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring\nfunctions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an\nexplanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how\nwell the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's\nprediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these\nquality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than\nexisting explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants\nhave to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual\ncontext. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations\nimproves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,\nincluding a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect\npredictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores\nin fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but\ntheir tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of\nsourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -\nChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a\n300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary\nprompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a\ntaxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of\nmodel outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately\nthree times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).\nQualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;\ninstead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported\ncharacterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general\nstatements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While\njournalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate\nauthoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose\njournalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue\nthat effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate\nattribution rather than optimize for fluency.",

        "title": "DeepSearch: Overcome the Bottleneck of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards via Monte Carlo Tree Search",
        "abstract": "Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced\nreasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training\nplateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating\nnotable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational\ninvestment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent\nin current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often\nmiss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the\nsolution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo\nTree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that\nrely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into\nthe training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit\nassignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,\nDeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,\nwhich leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training\nsteps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that\nprioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with\nentropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)\nadaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.\nExperiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves\n62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B\nreasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training\napproaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration\nover brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation\nfor advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for\nscaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged\ncomputation.",

        "title": "Rethinking Parameter Sharing for LLM Fine-Tuning with Multiple LoRAs",
        "abstract": "Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques\nsuch as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$\nis the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While\nmulti-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest\nthat the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus\nsuitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity\nis largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared\nknowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and\ntransfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \\textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric\nmulti-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in\nmulti-task fine-tuning, and \\textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients\nin federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,\nthrough a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous\nranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,\nmulti-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods\nachieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior\naverage accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches.

        "title": "Clarification as Supervision: Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Interfaces",
        "abstract": "Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning\ncapabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models\nto translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to\nproduce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that\nreasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often\nfail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical\nvisual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning\n(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through\ninteraction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training\nreveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we\ncreate pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to\nsolve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4\npoints over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%\nif those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit\nsupervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be\neffectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit\nannotations.",
