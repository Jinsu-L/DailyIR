        "abstract": "Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world\nNLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse\nhuman perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and\ncostly, the emerging \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm sheds light on a promising\napproach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,\nto date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona\ndescriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are\nnot generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose\nMAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically\nconstruct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant\ntext documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the\npersonas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate\nmulti-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational\nand medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results\nthat better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional\nautomated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.",

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,\nmost existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise\nallocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different\nresponse demands. Inspired by \"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\" which characterizes\ntwo distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and\nSystem 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that\ndifferent \"subregions\" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for\ntasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step\nlogical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework\nthat partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using\nfewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task\ndata via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on\nimportance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training\nSystem 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and\nintuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to\nreinforce deeper logical deliberation next.

In this paper, we describe our\nsolutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism\nIdentification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask\n1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address\neach subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck\nModel (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a\nfine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as\nhuman-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance.

Analysis of\nthese reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to\nidentify and code relevant cases.

We evaluated whether a fully\nautomated, open source \"text-to-table\" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)\ncould reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide\nPFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD\nreports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD\nToolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases\nwhere the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or\nyounger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern\nsub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72\nchild-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded\nclinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the\nchild-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the\nLLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's\n$\\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script\nruntime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one\nthat can be completed in minutes.

However,\nthis emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges. First, the\nsubstantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise\nurgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection. Second, their\npowerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce\nmisleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. To address these concerns,\nwe explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding\nimperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain\ndetectable by specialized algorithms. We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking\nframework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models. Waltz\nis inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are\nrarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold\ntokens''. Leveraging this insight, Waltz embeds watermarks by rewiring the\nsimilarity statistics between patch embeddings and cold token embeddings, and\ndetects watermarks using similarity z-scores. To minimize potential side\neffects, we introduce a similarity-based embedding position identification\nstrategy and employ projected gradient descent to constrain the watermark noise\nwithin a defined boundary. Extensive experiments using two popular LLMTS models\nacross seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Waltz achieves high watermark\ndetection accuracy with minimal impact on the quality of the generated time\nseries.",

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the\noriginal training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.\nThrough empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and\nBunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming\nto compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or\nsufficient data.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph\nCompletion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as\nblack-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC\nmethods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of\nerroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and\ndecisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural\ninformation with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of\nLLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge.\nWe propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first\nleverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural\ninformation into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction\nalgorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)\nthat needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format\ncomprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing\nmainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

        "abstract": "Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media-including hate speech, harassment,\nand trolling-poses growing challenges for platform safety and societal\nwellbeing. While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content\nafter it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful\nbehaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user\nrecidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field\nremains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing\nmethods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB\nprediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm\ndetection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral\nrisk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks\ndiffer by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In\naddition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine\nlearning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset\ncharacteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights\nmethodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and\nlimited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including\nmultilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop\nsystems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims\nto guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB\nprediction.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in recommender systems rely on external resources such as\nknowledge graphs or large language models to enhance recommendations, which\nlimit applicability in real-world settings due to data dependency and\ncomputational overhead. Although knowledge-free models are able to bolster\nrecommendations by direct edge operations as well, the absence of augmentation\nprimitives drives them to fall short in bridging semantic and structural gaps\nas high-quality paradigm substitutes. Unlike existing diffusion-based works\nthat remodel user-item interactions, this work proposes NodeDiffRec, a\npioneering knowledge-free augmentation framework that enables fine-grained\nnode-level graph generation for recommendations and expands the scope of\nrestricted augmentation primitives via diffusion. By synthesizing pseudo-items\nand corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for\ninjection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference\nmodeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and\nstructural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the\nsuperiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with\nmaximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5\nover selected baselines.",

As the industry expands to meet\nrising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks,\ninefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies,\nand critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water\nquality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant\nprogress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the\ndomain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nAQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed\nto support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this\neffort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic\nFramework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a\ncombination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated\nevaluation techniques.

        "abstract": "A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on\nuser-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce\nharmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation.\nDeploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses\nsignificant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable\npolicies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.\nConsequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies\nand adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing\nfine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,\nrestricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive\nretraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited\ncontext lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies\ncomprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's\njudgment on \"precedents\", which are the reasoning processes of prior data\npoints similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed\npolicies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the\nguardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for\ncollecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents\nfor robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios\nand exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.",

While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks\nhave emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language\nunderstanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches\noften rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating\nnatural language into formal logic representations.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based\nJoint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework\nfor converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing\ninspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by\nefficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as\nSystem 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the\nNL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework\ncomprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and\nSpearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical\ntranslation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.\n  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA\nachieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational\noverhead compared to larger LLM-based systems.

A major\nchallenge we address is publication imbalance, where some researchers publish\nmuch more than others, often across several topics. Without careful handling,\ntheir less frequent interests are hidden under dominant topics, limiting the\nnetwork's ability to detect their full research scope. To tackle this, we\nintroduce a cloning strategy that clusters a researcher's publications and\ntreats each cluster as a separate node.

Edges in real-world networks often have timestamps, so there\nis a need for temporal motif mining. A temporal motif is a richer structure\nthat imposes timing constraints on the edges of the motif. Temporal motifs have\nbeen used to analyze social networks, financial transactions, and biological\nnetworks.\n  Motif counting in temporal graphs is particularly challenging. A graph with\nmillions of edges can have trillions of temporal motifs, since the same edge\ncan occur with multiple timestamps. There is a combinatorial explosion of\npossibilities, and state-of-the-art algorithms cannot manage motifs with more\nthan four vertices.\n  In this work, we present TIMEST: a general, fast, and accurate estimation\nalgorithm to count temporal motifs of arbitrary sizes in temporal networks. Our\napproach introduces a temporal spanning tree sampler that leverages weighted\nsampling to generate substructures of target temporal motifs. This method\ncarefully takes a subset of temporal constraints of the motif that can be\njointly and efficiently sampled. TIMEST uses randomized estimation techniques\nto obtain accurate estimates of motif counts.\n  We give theoretical guarantees on the running time and approximation\nguarantees of TIMEST. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and show\nthat TIMEST is both faster and more accurate than previous algorithms. Our CPU\nimplementation exhibits an average speedup of 28x over state-of-the-art GPU\nimplementation of the exact algorithm, and 6x speedup over SOTA approximate\nalgorithms while consistently showcasing less than 5% error in most cases. For\nexample, TIMEST can count the number of instances of a financial fraud temporal\nmotif in four minutes with 0.6% error, while exact methods take more than two\ndays.",

This survey provides a comprehensive review of available\nEnglish, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on\ntheir diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We\npresent a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting\ntheir strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth\nerror analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted\nthat there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a\nstandard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we\nformulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the\nevaluation diagnostics benchmarks: \"Why do not we have an evaluation standard\nfor the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?\" similar to ISO standard in\nindustry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered\nlinguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy\nfor linguistic phenomena in future.
