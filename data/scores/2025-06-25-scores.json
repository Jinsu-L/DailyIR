        "title": "NEAR$^2$: A Nested Embedding Approach to Efficient Product Retrieval and Ranking",
        "abstract": "E-commerce information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to simultaneously\nachieve high accuracy in interpreting complex user queries and maintain\nefficient processing of vast product catalogs. The dual challenge lies in\nprecisely matching user intent with relevant products while managing the\ncomputational demands of real-time search across massive inventories. In this\npaper, we propose a Nested Embedding Approach to product Retrieval and Ranking,\ncalled NEAR$^2$, which can achieve up to $12$ times efficiency in embedding\nsize at inference time while introducing no extra cost in training and\nimproving performance in accuracy for various encoder-based Transformer models.\nWe validate our approach using different loss functions for the retrieval and\nranking task, including multiple negative ranking loss and online contrastive\nloss, on four different test sets with various IR challenges such as short and\nimplicit queries. Our approach achieves an improved performance over a smaller\nembedding dimension, compared to any existing models.",

This article provides a comprehensive\nreview of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher\neducation, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We\nsynthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of\nconversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural\nlearning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic\nmethod, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting\nstrategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors\nwith these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive\nlearning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where\nLLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it\nchallenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps\nin applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency\nto provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,\nand the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human\nexpertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better\nalign LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts\nthat encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student\nreflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and\ncontextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory\nand the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering\ninsights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive\nand theory-aligned.",

Prior modular\npipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end\n(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by\nfixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce\n\\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system\nthat can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for\nfine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level\nlandmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a\nreversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains\nhistorical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory\n(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time\nobstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply\nprunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are\ndecoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and\nMap2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based\nLLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13\npp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW\nimprovement.

        "abstract": "Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce\nthe memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).\nNevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV\ncache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel\nframework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the\nKV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment\nresults demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,\nSKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves\nsignificantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,\nwith only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of\n4.73.",

We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking\nStrategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no\nadditional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition\nsequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling\nindependent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes\nthe joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches\n(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces\nthe number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding\nsubstantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In\nexperiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -\ndomains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel\nconfidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser.

        "abstract": "This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social\nsimulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to\nsocial science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling\nhuman-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face\nfundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern\ndiscovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''\nthat lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for\nsimulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:\nalignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency\n(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness\n(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for\ndetermining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science\nunderstanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when\nfocusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)\nagent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited\nvariance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation\nrobustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in\ndetermining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.",

        "abstract": "Despite extensive research on Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion\nDetection Systems (ML-NIDS), their capability to detect diverse attack variants\nremains uncertain. Prior studies have largely relied on homogeneous datasets,\nwhich artificially inflate performance scores and offer a false sense of\nsecurity. Designing systems that can effectively detect a wide range of attack\nvariants remains a significant challenge. The progress of ML-NIDS continues to\ndepend heavily on human expertise, which can embed subjective judgments of\nsystem designers into the model, potentially hindering its ability to\ngeneralize across diverse attack types.\n  To address this gap, we propose KnowML, a framework for knowledge-guided\nmachine learning that integrates attack knowledge into ML-NIDS. KnowML\nsystematically explores the threat landscape by leveraging Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to perform automated analysis of attack implementations. It\nconstructs a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) of attack strategies, on which it\napplies symbolic reasoning to generate KG-Augmented Input, embedding domain\nknowledge directly into the design process of ML-NIDS.\n  We evaluate KnowML on 28 realistic attack variants, of which 10 are newly\ncollected for this study. Our findings reveal that baseline ML-NIDS models fail\nto detect several variants entirely, achieving F1 scores as low as 0 %. In\ncontrast, our knowledge-guided approach achieves up to 99 % F1 score while\nmaintaining a False Positive Rate below 0.1 %.",

        "abstract": "Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real\nworld, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with\nthe same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same\npatterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation\npreference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.\nDiffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great\nsuccess in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and\nrepresent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of\nadaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,\nwe use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the\ndiversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model\nbased on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the\noriginal distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition\nmodel, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse\nreconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is\ncompleted by injecting multi-interests representational information that\neliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In\nthe inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition\nby using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to\nreconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments\non three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on\naccuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes\nthe degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.",

Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,\nresulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We\nintroduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust\nfunction calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.\nAs an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional\ndecision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically\nselecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The\nGraph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph\n(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with\nhistorical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search\nstrategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful\ntoolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent\nconsistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation\nmodels and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,\nToolLLM, {\\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,\nand Deepseek-V3, respectively.

This work\ninvestigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised\nwithin the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a\ncomplete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based\nlanguage VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a\nsupporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The\nexperiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under\nexplicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -\ncan be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation\nresults in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior\nknowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the\nmodel to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on\nKey. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into\ndecoder-only language models.

The key\nchallenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of\nLVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,\noffering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;\nlinguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.\nTo address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,\nwhich continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference\nbudget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question\nanswering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates\ncontent-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively\ninject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level\noffline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate\nhallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more\nheuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional\nvisual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and\ninformative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them\nfor LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely\nused benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning\ntasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and\nReinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through\ncomprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and\nintegration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key\ndifferences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes\nto LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective\noptimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training\neffectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both\nfine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach\nsimultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using\ndemonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage\nsequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average\naccuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically\ndegrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.\nWhile channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized\ncauses, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe\nPre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier\nformation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key\ninnovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while\nmaintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing\nchannel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,\nredistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We\nvalidate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is\nthe first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive\n4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10\nbenchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%\ntraining overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis\n(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally\naltering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not\ninherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way\nfor more efficient LLM deployment.

These approaches do not explicitly\naccount for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively\nintegrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific\norgan lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the\nstrong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we\npropose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual\nfeature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.\nSpecifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in\na CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from\ndifferent perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and\nalign them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.\nExperiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show\nthat our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves\nstate-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.",

The joint TAED (J-TAED) is trained\nwith both speech and text input modalities together, while it only takes speech\ndata as input during inference. The trained model can unify the internal\nrepresentations from different modalities, and be further extended to\ntext-based domain adaptation. It can effectively alleviate data scarcity for\nmismatch domain tasks since no speech data is required. Our experiments show\nJ-TAED successfully integrates speech and linguistic information into one\nmodel, and reduce the WER by 5.8 ~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset. The model\nis also evaluated on two out-of-domain datasets: one is finance and another is\nnamed entity focused. The text-based domain adaptation brings 15.3% and 17.8%\nWER reduction on those two datasets respectively.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,\nundermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation\nmethods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic\nvariability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose\nFiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to\nevaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences\nin long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on\nsentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis\nby operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the\nconsistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into\nsemantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to\ncompare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of\nsubtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and\nvalidate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,\nrace, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced\nbiases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming\nvarious evaluation metrics.",

        "abstract": "The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression\nand conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a\nsignificant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the\nclassification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in\nexisting research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text\nthat incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data\nsourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model\ntailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the\nissue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,\nwhich facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble\nmodel. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a\nmacro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In\naddition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed\ninstances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to\noccasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high\nconfidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we\nidentified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,\nparticularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal\nand non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied\nLIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in\nunderstanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings\nhighlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online\ncommunal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in\ncommunal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming\nto refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.",

However, the data\ncuration process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily\nrelies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated\nruntime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most\nexisting datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.\nTo this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that\nsystematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our\ndataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct\nGitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language\nand a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.\nWe have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training\ntrajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE\nmodel on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the\ntrained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs\ncontinues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of\nsaturation.

We argue that\nanalyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to\nunderstanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution\nmethods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual\nimportance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the\nmodel generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box\nmethod of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which\nidentified \"broadcasting\" sentences that receive disproportionate attention\nfrom all future sentences via \"receiver\" attention heads; (3) a causal\nattribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by\nsuppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each\nfuture sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of\nthought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that\ndisproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought\nanchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an\nopen-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our\nmethods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods\nthat map how a model performs multi-step reasoning.

        "title": "Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs",
        "abstract": "The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around\ndetection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about\ntoxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their\ntrustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on\nexplainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate\nfree-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text\nperturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a\nnovel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned\nFaithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity\nexplanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We\ndevelop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively\nevaluate \\haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and\nhighlight how \"non-ideal\" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments\non three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five\ndiverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible\nexplanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when\nprompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the\nindividual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and\nnonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations\nat https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF.",

        "title": "HAWAII: Hierarchical Visual Knowledge Transfer for Efficient Vision-Language Models",
        "abstract": "Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)\nis crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using\nmultiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs\nsignificant computational costs during training and inference. To address this\nchallenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from\nmultiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit\nthe complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational\noverhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between\ndifferent teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters\nfor multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a\nspecific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable\nefficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained\ndistillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed\nto emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the\ncoarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and\ntransfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with\na router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate\nthe superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.",
