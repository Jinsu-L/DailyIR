#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Mixed Modality Search
- **Aim**: To mitigate the modality gap in mixed modality search using contrastive vision-language models
- **Rationale**: The modality gap in CLIP's embedding space causes intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal fusion failure, leading to poor performance in mixed modality search
- **Ground**: The authors propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding space
- **Experiment**: GR-CLIP is evaluated on MixBench, a newly created benchmark for mixed modality search, and achieves significant improvements in NDCG@10
- **Takeaway**: GR-CLIP is an effective approach to mitigating the modality gap in mixed modality search, demonstrating substantial performance gains across different modalities and evaluation metrics

#### Abstract
> Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Question Answering Tasks
- **Aim**: To develop a novel approach to distill utility judgment capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient models for RAG
- **Rationale**: The high computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of passages evaluated, making it problematic for complex queries
- **Ground**: Utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer quality
- **Experiment**: Evaluation on two QA datasets from BEIR using two retrievers, and experiments on the HotpotQA dataset comparing various models
- **Takeaway**: Utility-based RAG is essential for complex QA tasks, and distillation of utility-based selection capability from larger models into smaller, efficient models is crucial for practical deployment

#### Abstract
> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized
relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In
contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the
usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical
evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high
computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of
passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries
requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to
distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient
models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,
enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the
need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer
generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window
method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate
that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution
for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer
quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher
model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into
RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex
questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in
enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking
and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting
further research in this area.

natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with
information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and
contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of
RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question
answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse
applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG,
particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in
parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms,
sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in
detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends,
providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the
deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Passage Injection for Enhancing Robustness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems
- **Aim**: To enhance the robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by incorporating retrieved passages into the reasoning process of large language models (LLMs)
- **Rationale**: To address the issue of noisy passages that can mislead the model and result in incorrect answers, and to leverage the strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of LLMs

- **Experiment**: Validating Passage Injection using four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA datasets, and conducting experiments under two noisy retrieval scenarios: Random Noise and Counterfactual Noise
- **Takeaway**: Passage Injection enhances robustness against noisy passages, improves the utilization of helpful passages, and reduces output length, suggesting a promising direction for building more robust RAG systems

#### Abstract
> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large
language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e.,
low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is
critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have
equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing
them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by
this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that
explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming
to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We
validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the
retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA
datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG
performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,
where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,
where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently
improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can
also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that
incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for
building more robust RAG systems. The code can be found

### 5. PBiLoss: Popularity-Aware Regularization to Improve Fairness in Graph-Based Recommender Systems

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Mohammad Naeimi, Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19067v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-25 08:29:32
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, rag, recommend, rank
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on recommender systems, which is related to the user's interests in information retrieval and search technologies. However, the specific topic of graph-based recommender systems and fairness is not directly aligned with the user's primary focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The paper's emphasis on recommender systems and popularity bias is somewhat relevant, but not a central match for the user's research interests.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Mitigating Popularity Bias in Graph-Based Recommender Systems
- **Aim**: To propose a novel regularization-based loss function, PBiLoss, to reduce popularity bias in graph-based recommender systems
- **Rationale**: Popularity bias leads to reduced content diversity and compromised fairness, and existing methods are limited in addressing this issue
- **Ground**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their applications in recommender systems, which can capture complex relationships and dependencies in user-item interactions
- **Experiment**: Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets, evaluating PBiLoss with different baseline models and hyperparameter settings
- **Takeaway**: PBiLoss is a robust and effective method for mitigating popularity bias, offering a model-agnostic, easily integrable, and effective solution for improving fairness in recommender systems

#### Abstract
> Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
have achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns.
However, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to
over-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and
compromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel
regularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in
graph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional
training objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,
thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more
personalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive
(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the
contribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We
further explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed
popularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach
flexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as
LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as
demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU)
and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even
enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results
highlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the
optimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing
accuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.

### 6. Towards Domain Specification of Embedding Models in Medicine

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Mohammad Khodadad, Ali Shiraee, Mahdi Astaraki, Hamidreza Mahyar
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19407v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-25 16:15:00
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, ctr, retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on medical text embedding models, which is outside the user's primary interest in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. While it touches on topics like text retrieval and evaluation, the domain and methodology are not directly applicable to the user's research areas.

#### Abstract
> Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare
applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information
retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two
critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of
medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of
methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and
semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often
inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full
spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned
on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across
multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks
spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled
on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of
medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only
establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that
consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

### 7. Agent0: Leveraging LLM Agents to Discover Multi-value Features from Text for Enhanced Recommendations

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Bla≈æ ≈†krlj, Beno√Æt Guilleminot, Andra≈æ Tori
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18993v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-25 06:45:10
- **Comment**: Agent4IR, KDD '25
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, recommend, search, acl
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on recommender systems and leveraging large language models (LLMs) for feature construction, which is somewhat related to the user's interests in information retrieval and search technologies. However, the primary focus on recommender systems and feature engineering is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes, such as query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) and their associated agent-based frameworks have
significantly advanced automated information extraction, a critical component
of modern recommender systems. While these multitask frameworks are widely used
in code generation, their application in data-centric research is still largely
untapped. This paper presents Agent0, an LLM-driven, agent-based system
designed to automate information extraction and feature construction from raw,
unstructured text. Categorical features are crucial for large-scale recommender
systems but are often expensive to acquire. Agent0 coordinates a group of
interacting LLM agents to automatically identify the most valuable text aspects
for subsequent tasks (such as models or AutoML pipelines). Beyond its feature
engineering capabilities, Agent0 also offers an automated prompt-engineering
tuning method that utilizes dynamic feedback loops from an oracle. Our findings
demonstrate that this closed-loop methodology is both practical and effective
for automated feature discovery, which is recognized as one of the most
challenging phases in current recommender system development.

### 8. Let It Go? Not Quite: Addressing Item Cold Start in Sequential Recommendations with Content-Based Initialization

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Anton Pembek, Artem Fatkulin, Anton Klenitskiy, Alexey Vasilev
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19473v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-25 17:57:31
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, recommend, commerce, e-commerce
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on sequential recommender systems and the cold start problem, which is somewhat related to my interests in information retrieval and search technologies. However, the paper's primary focus is on recommender systems, which is not my core area of interest. The use of content-based initialization and fine-tuning of embeddings is also relevant to my background in e-commerce, but the paper's scope is limited to recommender systems and does not explore deeper semantic understanding or real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where
items with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due
to the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage
item metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use
embeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as
initialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content
embeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt
to the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can
degrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far
from their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to
address this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or
fine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen
embeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting
them go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach
demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities,
including e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset
with audio-based representation.

### 9. MindFlow+: A Self-Evolving Agent for E-Commerce Customer Service

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Ming Gong, Xucheng Huang, Ziheng Xu, Vijayan K. Asari
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18884v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-25 02:01:55
- **Topic Keywords**: relevance, commerce, e-commerce
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on dialogue agents for e-commerce customer service, which is related to the user's background in the e-commerce domain. However, the paper's primary focus is on dialogue systems and imitation learning, rather than information retrieval or search technologies, which are the user's core research interests.

#### Abstract
> High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet
traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn
interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns
domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with
imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+
introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented
demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and
agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and
reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific
goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response
generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying
AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations
show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance,
flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build
domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

### 10. PrismRAG: Boosting RAG Factuality with Distractor Resilience and Strategized Reasoning

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Mohammad Kachuee, Teja Gollapudi, Minseok Kim, Yin Huang, Kai Sun, Xiao Yang, Jiaqi Wang, Nirav Shah, Yue Liu, Aaron Colak, Anuj Kumar, Wen-tau Yih, Xin Luna Dong
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18857v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-25 00:15:31
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper proposes a framework for improving the factuality of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models, which is a topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While it's related to query understanding and ranking models, the focus is on improving the quality of generated text rather than search ranking or user behavior modeling. The paper's relevance to information retrieval is limited, and it doesn't seem to address the user behavior modeling or click models that are of interest.

#### Abstract
> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context
includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require
deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient
fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with
distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages,
and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize,
and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions.
Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application
domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

### 11. GEPA: Reflective Prompt Evolution Can Outperform Reinforcement Learning

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Lakshya A Agrawal, Shangyin Tan, Dilara Soylu, Noah Ziems, Rishi Khare, Krista Opsahl-Ong, Arnav Singhvi, Herumb Shandilya, Michael J Ryan, Meng Jiang, Christopher Potts, Koushik Sen, Alexandros G. Dimakis, Ion Stoica, Dan Klein, Matei Zaharia, Omar Khattab
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-25 17:42:32
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, search
- **Reason**: The paper explores the use of genetic-pareto optimization to improve language model prompts, which is related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on reinforcement learning and natural language processing is not directly aligned with the user's primary interests in search technologies and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue
that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer
learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,
scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt
optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn
high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or
more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool
calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose
problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons
from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it
can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four
tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up
to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,
MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an
inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

### 12. A Markov Categorical Framework for Language Modeling

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Yifan Zhang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19247v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-25 13:14:03
- **Comment**: Project Page: https://github.com/asiresearch/lm-theory
- **Topic Keywords**: ctr, search
- **Reason**: The paper introduces a new framework for understanding language models, focusing on the Markov categorical perspective and its implications for information flow and learned geometry. While it touches on the topic of sequence probabilities and objective functions, it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest for your research. The paper's focus on language modeling and its theoretical aspects makes it somewhat relevant, but not a central match for your research themes.

#### Abstract
> Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are
trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While
empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple
objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work
introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to
deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the
single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category
Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,
allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes
three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic
rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,
quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods
exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn
not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a
process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we
prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive
learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,
we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align
with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a
geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This
compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural
principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:

### 13. CityHood: An Explainable Travel Recommender System for Cities and Neighborhoods

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Gustavo H Santos, Myriam Delgado, Thiago H Silva
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18778v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-24 20:01:24
- **Comment**: Accepted at ASONAM'25
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, recommend
- **Reason**: The paper presents a travel recommender system that leverages user interests and geographic indicators, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the focus on location-based recommendations and cultural alignment is not directly aligned with the user's primary interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The paper's relevance is limited to the user's secondary interest in recommender systems.

#### Abstract
> We present CityHood, an interactive and explainable recommendation system
that suggests cities and neighborhoods based on users' areas of interest. The
system models user interests leveraging large-scale Google Places reviews
enriched with geographic, socio-demographic, political, and cultural
indicators. It provides personalized recommendations at city (Core-Based
Statistical Areas - CBSAs) and neighborhood (ZIP code) levels, supported by an
explainable technique (LIME) and natural-language explanations. Users can
explore recommendations based on their stated preferences and inspect the
reasoning behind each suggestion through a visual interface. The demo
illustrates how spatial similarity, cultural alignment, and interest
understanding can be used to make travel recommendations transparent and
engaging. This work bridges gaps in location-based recommendation by combining
a kind of interest modeling, multi-scale analysis, and explainability in a
user-facing system.

### 14. Debating Truth: Debate-driven Claim Verification with Multiple Large Language Model Agents

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Haorui He, Yupeng Li, Dacheng Wen, Reynold Cheng, Francis C. M. Lau
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19090v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-25 09:19:25
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper's focus on claim verification and debate-driven methodology is somewhat related to information retrieval, particularly in the context of query understanding and ranking models. However, the paper's emphasis on natural language processing and large language models is not directly aligned with the user's interests in search technologies and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the
state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification
that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking
practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that
adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework,
two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round
argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict
with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we
introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data

- **Submitted**: 2025-07-25 09:07:52
- **Comment**: Preprint
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on argument summarization, which is not directly related to the user's primary research interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. While the paper mentions large language diffusion models, which are related to NLP, the application is specific to argument summarization and does not align with the user's interests in query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations
of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the
identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage
remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass
generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural
refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language
diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided
remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller
with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported,
redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent
outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation
metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across
core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the
effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

- **Comment**: Accepted to be published in RecSys'25, 10 pages, 3 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend, search
- **Reason**: The paper explores the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in recommender systems, specifically in the context of linear bandits. While it touches on the topic of evaluation protocols, it does not directly relate to query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest for your research. The focus on recommender systems is also somewhat tangential to your primary interest in information retrieval.

#### Abstract
> Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are widely used in recommender systems
that require continuous, incremental learning. A core aspect of MABs is the
exploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to
be enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear
bandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the
same linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration
strategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is
increasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration
behavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of
several linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy
linear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier
performance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This
observation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which
consistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that
pure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.
Our results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for
bandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory
efficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for
developing more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations
into alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender
systems.

- **Submitted**: 2025-07-25 13:59:54
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend
- **Reason**: The paper explores group recommender systems, which is a related topic to information retrieval, but it focuses on recommender systems rather than search technologies. The use of large language models (LLMs) is also relevant to my interests in NLP, but the application is different from my primary focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> In contrast to single-user recommender systems, group recommender systems are
designed to generate and explain recommendations for groups. This
group-oriented setting introduces additional complexities, as several factors -
absent in individual contexts - must be addressed. These include understanding
group dynamics (e.g., social dependencies within the group), defining effective
decision-making processes, ensuring that recommendations are suitable for all
group members, and providing group-level explanations as well as explanations
for individual users. In this paper, we analyze in which way large language
models (LLMs) can support these aspects and help to increase the overall
decision support quality and applicability of group recommender systems.

- **Comment**: RecSys 2025 Industry Track
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend
- **Reason**: The paper explores recommender systems, which is somewhat related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. However, the focus on music recommendation and shared content-based features ('semantic IDs') is not directly aligned with the user's primary focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Training recommender systems for next-item recommendation often requires
unique embeddings to be learned for each item, which may take up most of the
trainable parameters for a model. Shared embeddings, such as using content
information, can reduce the number of distinct embeddings to be stored in
memory. This allows for a more lightweight model; correspondingly, model
complexity can be increased due to having fewer embeddings to store in memory.
We show the benefit of using shared content-based features ('semantic IDs') in
improving recommendation accuracy and diversity, while reducing model size, for
two music recommendation datasets, including an online A/B test on a music
streaming service.

- **Topic Keywords**: information retrieval, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: This paper is not relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. The topic of Private Information Retrieval (PIR) and code-based PIR schemes is not related to your areas of focus, and the paper does not discuss query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes allow clients to retrieve files
from a database without disclosing the requested file's identity to the server.
In the pursuit of post-quantum security, most recent PIR schemes rely on hard
lattice problems. In contrast, the so called CB-cPIR scheme stands out as a
pioneering effort to base PIR schemes on hard problems in coding theory,
thereby contributing significantly to the diversification of security
foundations. However, our research reveals a critical vulnerability in CB-cPIR,
substantially diminishing its security levels. Moreover, a comparative analysis
with state-of-the-art PIR schemes shows that CB-cPIR's advantages are reduced,
making it less competitive in terms of the communication cost. Nevertheless,
our findings highlight the importance of continued research into code-based PIR
schemes, as they have the potential to provide a valuable alternative to
lattice-based approaches.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on phenotype concept recognition in biomedical text mining, which is not directly related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. Although it involves text processing and entity linking, the context and application are distinct from the user's research areas.

#### Abstract
> Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text
mining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph
construction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific
training and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving
biomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method
that does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three
stages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging
strategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through
prompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show
that AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both
mention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive
capability and generalizability to new ontologies.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on code generation and retrieval-augmented code generation, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. While it mentions large language models, the context is different from the user's interests in NLP and data mining.

#### Abstract
> Existing retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) methods typically use an
external retrieval module to fetch semantically similar code snippets used for
generating subsequent fragments. However, even for consecutive code fragments,
the content often diverges due to logical progression, resulting in a content
gap. This gap undermines the performance of current RACG methods, as
\textit{external} retrieval modules based on content matching fail to infer the
specific information need of LLMs to generate the next code fragment.
Therefore, we propose \textbf{SelfRACG}, a novel paradigm that enables large
language models (LLMs) to \textbf{Self}-express their information needs to
enhance \textbf{RACG}. Specifically, SelfRACG includes an information need
expression module and a two-stage information need-guided training strategy,
which encourages LLMs to express their information need. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SelfRACG can retrieve external knowledge that better aligns
with the LLM's own information needs, resulting in superior generation
performance compared to vanilla RACG.

#### Abstract
> Legal document summarization represents a significant advancement towards
improving judicial efficiency through the automation of key information
detection. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques to meticulously identify and extract essential data from extensive
legal texts, which facilitates a more efficient review process. By employing
advanced machine learning algorithms, the framework recognizes underlying
patterns within judicial documents to create precise summaries that encapsulate
the crucial elements. This automation alleviates the burden on legal
professionals, concurrently reducing the likelihood of overlooking vital
information that could lead to errors. Through comprehensive experiments
conducted with actual legal datasets, we demonstrate the capability of our
method to generate high-quality summaries while preserving the integrity of the
original content and enhancing processing times considerably. The results
reveal marked improvements in operational efficiency, allowing legal
practitioners to direct their efforts toward critical analytical and
decision-making activities instead of manual reviews. This research highlights
promising technology-driven strategies that can significantly alter workflow
dynamics within the legal sector, emphasizing the role of automation in
refining judicial processes.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the field of education by
enabling personalized learning experiences tailored to individual student
needs. In this paper, we introduce a framework for Adaptive Learning Systems
that leverages LLM-powered analytics for personalized curriculum design. This
innovative approach uses advanced machine learning to analyze real-time data,
allowing the system to adapt learning pathways and recommend resources that
align with each learner's progress. By continuously assessing students, our
framework enhances instructional strategies, ensuring that the materials
presented are relevant and engaging. Experimental results indicate a marked
improvement in both learner engagement and knowledge retention when using a
customized curriculum. Evaluations conducted across varied educational
environments demonstrate the framework's flexibility and positive influence on
learning outcomes, potentially reshaping conventional educational practices
into a more adaptive and student-centered model.

Although the paper involves NLP techniques, the application domain and task are not aligned with the user's research themes.

#### Abstract
> In this study, we set a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in
Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical
scenarios and fit-for-purpose performance measures. We trained a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or
multilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the
tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using
102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text
clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of
one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal
Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE
RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities
(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on
detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged
F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences
for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best
performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and
0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best
in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using
predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs
were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful
approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text
documents. Our study highlights the need to use appropriate performance
measures fit for the task of ADE detection in clinical free-text documents and
envisioned future clinical use.

The paper's emphasis on multimodal fusion and timestamp alignment is also not relevant to the user's interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based
alignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker
Diarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy.
Misalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of
multimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational
contexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing
pre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing
timestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal
approach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio
embeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating
mechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset
demonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight
the critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness
in enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation
for robust multimodal emotion analysis.

The focus is on evaluating large language models, which is a topic in Natural Language Processing, but not specifically in the context of information retrieval or search.

#### Abstract
> Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced
model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public
benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair
comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments.
Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases
permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or
repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches
fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency
simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains
unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic
evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography.
ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and
Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii)
Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark
contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new
benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them
for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of
current LLMs. The source code is available at

Although it mentions reinforcement learning, the context is different from the user's focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code
reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious
cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule
Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to
generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious
cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety
and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms.
To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we
conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage
prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the
model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely
PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming
various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model
overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while
preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on augmenting large language models with external tools for mathematical reasoning, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. While it uses language models, the context and application are quite different from the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising
avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior
tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a
single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math
reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with
more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.
To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool
AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG
guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It
then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning
process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a
finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any
LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally
expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned
with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:
MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and
closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%
to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

While it mentions image-text retrieval, the context is creative domains like poetry and metaphor visualization, which is not a primary focus of the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.

The paper focuses on text detoxification, which is a topic in Natural Language Processing, but it does not align with your specific interests in deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text
Detoxification Task in the PAN-2025 competition for the ylmmcl team: a robust
multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided
tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and
an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from
prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word
annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with
greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves
the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J
score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also
achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance
outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and
shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian,
French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent
improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved
ninth place with a score of 0.612.

#### Abstract
> In natural language processing, multilingual models like mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa promise broad coverage but often struggle with languages that share
a script yet differ in orthographic norms and cultural context. This issue is
especially notable in Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic,
Persian, and Urdu. We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family:
four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its
specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script
features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by
general-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa
variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An
ablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these
gains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits
and domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value
of script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and
support further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language
specificity.

The focus is on event forecasting using large language models, which is outside your primary areas of interest. While the paper mentions reinforcement learning, it does not specifically address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast
doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved
evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching
superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been
reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success
of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that
technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been
developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the
time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training
methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three
difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,
knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present
related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,
utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward
signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling
datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how
these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to
society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths
and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,
aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on improving the performance of recurrent language models on long-context tasks, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. While it touches on the efficiency of language models, it does not address ranking models, user behavior modeling, or deep semantic understanding, making it only loosely relevant to the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear
computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to
self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic
complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks
due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused
on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural
innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match
the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that
this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not
well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a
chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth
Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual
information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more
compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method
substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention
LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of
Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from
5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.
Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and
inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using
Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope
our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further
progress, we will release code and dataset.

- **Reason**: This paper is not relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. The paper focuses on unsupervised word discovery and clustering in speech, which is a different domain and problem space from your areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> We investigate the problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like
units and clustering these to create a lexicon. Prior work can be categorized
into two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then
cluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods
incorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection.
However, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve
segmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in
whether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up
strategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent
self-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a
lexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic
programming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On
the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable
state-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times
faster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of
ES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate
boundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as
well. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor.
Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering
techniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations. Project

The paper focuses on the representation of gender stereotypes in Large Language Models, which is a topic in NLP, but it does not align with your specific interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of
domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes
and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and
professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to
ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a
structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three
different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a
hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive
grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current
LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular
LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google
Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600
responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate
stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'
pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in
AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in
the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.
Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and
assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather
contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include
expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt
engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

#### Abstract
> Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on multilingual language models and their performance across different languages, using sparse autoencoders to analyze activation patterns. While it touches on fine-tuning and adaptation, the primary concern is not query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are key aspects of information retrieval and search technologies. The paper's relevance to information retrieval and search is limited.

#### Abstract
> Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic
generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common
benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation
patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese
(zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource
languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam
(ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns.
Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations
in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To
address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for
Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at
approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but
consistent improvements, highlighting activation alignment as a key factor in
enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

The focus is on assessing the reproducibility of social science research using AI agents, which is outside the scope of the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for
promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With
recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate
their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for
reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using
provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2)
oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data
formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce
REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social
science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are
tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original
paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features
end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers
with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three
representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent
achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we
develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing
agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to
automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly
available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/REPRO-Bench.

#### Abstract
> AI-based Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have significant potential to
transform teaching and learning. As efforts continue to design, develop, and
integrate ITS into educational contexts, mixed results about their
effectiveness have emerged. This paper provides a comprehensive review to
understand how ITS operate in real educational settings and to identify the
associated challenges in their application and evaluation. We use a systematic
literature review method to analyze numerous qualified studies published from
2010 to 2025, examining domains such as pedagogical strategies, NLP, adaptive
learning, student modeling, and domain-specific applications of ITS. The
results reveal a complex landscape regarding the effectiveness of ITS,
highlighting both advancements and persistent challenges. The study also
identifies a need for greater scientific rigor in experimental design and data
analysis. Based on these findings, suggestions for future research and
practical implications are proposed.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on a specific domain (STEM education) and uses a different approach (speech translation) that is not directly related to the user's research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While it touches on the topic of language understanding, it is not centered around query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South,
fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par
with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to
follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most
cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower
resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a
promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too
expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this
paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing
real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time
multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex
English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also
describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

#### Abstract
> Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a
conversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language
processing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by
narrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the
code-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the
significance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this
context remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating
code-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from
seven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating
synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.
Our analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets
involving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training
data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.
