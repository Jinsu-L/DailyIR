        "abstract": "Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative\ngoals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as\nconversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their\npragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from\nWavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener\ncommunicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a\nrange of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using\ndirect and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational\nSpeech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM\ninference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve\nstrong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human\naccuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT\nprompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting,\nand using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study\nhelps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning\nabilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening\nup future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language\nunderstanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans.",

        "abstract": "We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for\ndiffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference\ntrajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different\narchitectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances\ntraining stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex\nmath and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific\nmodels to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing\nTraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models,\nnamely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still\nconsistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks.\nTraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first\nlong-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1%\nrelative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical\napplications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building,\ntraining, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The\nframework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for\nboth inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of\nvarious supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and\ngeneral tasks.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the\nreasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe\nefficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common\npractice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this\ndecoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby\nconstraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for\nlearning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate\nbetter cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT\nobjective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how\nto guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs\nRL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level\nexplicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint\nSFT-RL training over RL alone.

        "abstract": "Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve\nsignificant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains\nin instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that\ntightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by\nrecent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning\ncan further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving\nReasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based\nthinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to\nguide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained\ndetails, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train\nIRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),\nwhich targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate\nstage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality\ntextual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a\nsubsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed\nlearning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full\nthinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that\nnatively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first\nbuilds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline\nin the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA\nperformance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,\nGenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality\nand fine-grained fidelity.

Outcome-based RL,\nwhich rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields\nsubstantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation\ndiversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is\ncritical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL\npost-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce\neffective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our\nstudy highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,\nwhere reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and\n(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a\nlimited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose\noutcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final\noutcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,\nwhich encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch\nexploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time\ndiversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models\ndemonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity\ncollapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based\nexploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits.

We\ndemonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper\nagents through in-depth case studies.

We formalize PCN and\nprove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and\nmonotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,\nintegrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with\ncryptographic commitments.

Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded\narchitecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and\nranking stages. The complexity of designing and maintaining multiple modules\nmakes it difficult to achieve holistic performance gains. Recent advances in\ngenerative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative\nsearch as an alternative. However, existing approaches are not genuinely\nend-to-end: they typically train an item encoder to tokenize candidates first\nand then optimize a generator separately, leading to objective inconsistency\nand limited generalization.

UniSearch replaces\nthe cascaded pipeline with an end-to-end architecture that integrates a Search\nGenerator and a Video Encoder.

A unified training\nframework jointly optimizes both components, enabling mutual enhancement and\nimproving representation quality and generation accuracy. Furthermore, we\nintroduce Search Preference Optimization (SPO), which leverages a reward model\nand real user feedback to better align generation with user preferences.\nExtensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets, together with online A/B\ntesting in both short-video and live search scenarios, demonstrate the strong\neffectiveness and deployment potential of UniSearch.

However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low\nhallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\ntest-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive\nbenchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not\nconsistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more\nhallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination\nbehavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model\nchoosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual\nrecall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on\npreviously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case\nstudies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to\noverconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that\ncompared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data\nare available at https://github.com/XuZhao0/tts-knowledge",

In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation\narchitecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.\nSpecifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using\na central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized\nEvaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of\nthe reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We\ntested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark\ndesigned to diagnose the \"who\" (agent) and \"when\" (step) of a system's failure.\nRAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair\naccuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial\nincrease from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the\nHand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%).

Although extensive\nmethods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,\nrejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents\na key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and\nsecurity, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we\npropose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically\nallocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions\nof security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial\npotential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy\nand performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved\nMoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and\nhidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly\nclassifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during\nrouter optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong\nadaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including\nmainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs\noptimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for\nuser interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction\nFine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task\nperformance gains via a simple data-mix strategy.

We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable\ncontinued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust\nin-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning\nfor broader chat workflows.\n  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural\ncausal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024.

        "abstract": "Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective\npost-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise\nLLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,\nraising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this\ninsight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,\nwhich we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To\nmitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a\nprojection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of\neach training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis\nshows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the\nrefusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by\noverall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our\nobservation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we\nintroduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and\nbroaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an\nenhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,\nand LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks\nposed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong\nbaselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.\nCrucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the\nr-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration\nof LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety\nresearch.",

The recordings were processed with\nWhisperX and Wav2Vec 2.0 to extract automated audio-text alignment. Our\nprocessing pipeline improves upon the ParCzech 3.0 speech recognition version\nby extracting more data with higher alignment reliability. The dataset is\noffered in three flexible variants: (1) sentence-segmented for automatic speech\nrecognition and speech synthesis tasks with clean boundaries, (2) unsegmented\npreserving original utterance flow across sentences, and (3) a raw-alignment\nfor further custom refinement for other possible tasks. All variants maintain\nthe original metadata and are released under a permissive CC-BY license. The\ndataset is available in the LINDAT repository, with the sentence-segmented and\nunsegmented variants additionally available on Hugging Face.",

The Gini coefficient in\nplay counts is notably greater than that of existing mainstream genres and\nother growing niche genres.

We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a\nparameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE\nintroduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing\nof attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the\nmagnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,\nthese modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and\nfuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled\npolicy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,\nmaking it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA\nbenchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces\nhallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest\noverhead.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses\n(hallucinations) when faced with questions beyond their knowledge scope.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by leveraging external\nknowledge, but a critical challenge remains: determining whether retrieved\ncontexts effectively enhance the model`s ability to answer specific queries.\nThis challenge underscores the importance of knowledge boundary awareness,\nwhich current methods-relying on discrete labels or limited signals-fail to\naddress adequately, as they overlook the rich information in LLMs` continuous\ninternal hidden states. To tackle this, we propose a novel post-retrieval\nknowledge filtering approach. First, we construct a confidence detection model\nbased on LLMs` internal hidden states to quantify how retrieved contexts\nenhance the model`s confidence. Using this model, we build a preference dataset\n(NQ_Rerank) to fine-tune a reranker, enabling it to prioritize contexts\npreferred by the downstream LLM during reranking. Additionally, we introduce\nConfidence-Based Dynamic Retrieval (CBDR), which adaptively triggers retrieval\nbased on the LLM`s initial confidence in the original question, reducing\nknowledge conflicts and improving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in accuracy for context screening and end-to-end RAG\nperformance, along with a notable reduction in retrieval costs while\nmaintaining competitive accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Spotify has recently introduced audiobooks as part of its catalog,\ncomplementing its music and podcast offering. Search is often the first entry\npoint for users to access new items, and an important goal for Spotify is to\nsupport users in the exploration of the audiobook catalog. More specifically,\nwe would like to enable users without a specific item in mind to broadly search\nby topic, genre, story tropes, decade, and discover audiobooks, authors and\npublishers they may like. To do this, we need to 1) inspire users to type more\nexploratory queries for audiobooks and 2) augment our retrieval systems to\nbetter deal with exploratory audiobook queries. This is challenging in a\ncold-start scenario, where we have a retrievabiliy bias due to the little\namount of user interactions with audiobooks compared to previously available\nitems such as music and podcast content. To address this, we propose\nAudioBoost, a system to boost audiobook retrievability in Spotify's Search via\nsynthetic query generation. AudioBoost leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto generate synthetic queries conditioned on audiobook metadata. The synthetic\nqueries are indexed both in the Query AutoComplete (QAC) and in the Search\nRetrieval engine to improve query formulation and retrieval at the same time.\nWe show through offline evaluation that synthetic queries increase\nretrievability and are of high quality. Moreover, results from an online A/B\ntest show that AudioBoost leads to a +0.7% in audiobook impressions, +1.22% in\naudiobook clicks, and +1.82% in audiobook exploratory query completions.",

        "abstract": "Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various\nsuccessful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful\nresponses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate\nGradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes\nthe tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several\nimproved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length\nsuffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains\nunexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that\nemploys learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.\nOur approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact\npositions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only\nreduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby\nlowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve\nsuccessful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the\noriginal GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most\ntokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a\nminority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the\nattack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.\nOur findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs\nfrom the perspective of jailbreak attacks.",

To address this issue, we first\nreproduce and publicly release the synthetic data proposed by Wang et al.\n(Mistral-E5). Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent\nimprovements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly\nsynthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that\nbenefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual\ndatasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different\ncategories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another.\nOur findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for\nbuilding general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on\nsynthetic data leads to more robust embedding models across tasks.",

        "title": "From Long to Short: LLMs Excel at Trimming Own Reasoning Chains",
        "abstract": "O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward\nover conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to\ngenerate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide\nrange of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are\nprone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple\nproblems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted\nreasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we\nconduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set\nof LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple\ngeneration objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,\nwe propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference\nTrimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct\nreasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while\njointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,\nallowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between\nconciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and\ndatasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,\nproducing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user\nexperience.",

        "title": "Benchmarking Gender and Political Bias in Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language\nmodels (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament\ndebate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic\nmetadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age,\ncountry, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art\nLLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing\nconsistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female\nMEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female\nspeakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming\non both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform\nopen-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release\nthe EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness\nand accountability in NLP within political contexts.",

        "title": "Reverse-Engineered Reasoning for Open-Ended Generation",
        "abstract": "While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in\nverifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative\ngeneration remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for\ninstilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction\ndistillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear\nreward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is\nprohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a\nnew paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a\nreasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works\n``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,\nstep-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this\nscalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a\nlarge-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.\nOur model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong\nopen-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at\ntimes superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.",
