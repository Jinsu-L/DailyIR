        "abstract": "This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning\nstrategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key\nchallenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of\nLVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,\noffering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;\nlinguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.\nTo address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,\nwhich continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference\nbudget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question\nanswering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates\ncontent-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively\ninject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level\noffline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate\nhallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more\nheuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional\nvisual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and\ninformative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them\nfor LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely\nused benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity\nof generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions\nin VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic\ncoverage.

We identify the core computational\nbottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly\nmatrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we\npropose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector\nmultiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational\ncost to quadratic.

        "abstract": "The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression\nand conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a\nsignificant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the\nclassification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in\nexisting research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text\nthat incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data\nsourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model\ntailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the\nissue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,\nwhich facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble\nmodel. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a\nmacro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In\naddition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed\ninstances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to\noccasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high\nconfidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we\nidentified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,\nparticularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal\nand non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied\nLIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in\nunderstanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings\nhighlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online\ncommunal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in\ncommunal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming\nto refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.",

        "title": "Scaling Speculative Decoding with Lookahead Reasoning",
        "abstract": "Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the\nresulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)\nhelps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire\n$\\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\\gamma$ grows. This\nmeans allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic\nceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this\nceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of\nparallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,\nand each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.\nIn Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future\nsteps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a\nverifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate\nany that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the\ntwo layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak\nspeedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other\nbenchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x\nwhile preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional\nGPU throughput.

While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling\nhuman-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face\nfundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern\ndiscovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''\nthat lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for\nsimulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:\nalignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency\n(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness\n(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for\ndetermining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science\nunderstanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when\nfocusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)\nagent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited\nvariance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation\nrobustness.

In the real\nworld, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with\nthe same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same\npatterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation\npreference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.\nDiffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great\nsuccess in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and\nrepresent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of\nadaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,\nwe use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the\ndiversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model\nbased on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the\noriginal distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition\nmodel, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse\nreconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is\ncompleted by injecting multi-interests representational information that\neliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In\nthe inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition\nby using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to\nreconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments\non three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on\naccuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes\nthe degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning\ntasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and\nReinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through\ncomprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and\nintegration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key\ndifferences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes\nto LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective\noptimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training\neffectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both\nfine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach\nsimultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using\ndemonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage\nsequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average\naccuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.",

ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to\nlong-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We\nbuild on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent\nattention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match\nthe accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a\nstrong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are\njust as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training\nparadigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than\nLCA with 44% higher throughput.

        "abstract": "Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide users with personalized medical information.\nTo prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC developers must\nevaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases before\ndeployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare diseases is\ndifficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is costly and\nimpractical. This study proposes and validates a novel Synthetic Vignette\nSimulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual\nrare diseases following SC algorithm updates. We used disease-phenotype\nannotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), a knowledge database for\nrare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With these, we simulated SC\ninterviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates on real-world diagnostic\nperformance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated retrospectively by\ncomparing estimated values with actual metric changes using the $R^2$\ncoefficient. The experiment included eight past SC algorithm updates. For\nupdates on diseases with frequency information in HPO (n=5), the $R^2$ for\nRecall@8 change was 0.831 ($p$=0.031), and for Precision@8 change, it was 0.78\n($p$=0.047), indicating the method can predict post-deployment performance. In\ncontrast, large prediction errors occurred for diseases without frequency\ninformation (n=3), highlighting its importance. Our method enables\npre-deployment evaluation of SC algorithm changes for individual rare diseases\nusing a publicly available, expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and\nlow-cost approach allows developers to efficiently improve diagnostic\nperformance for rare diseases, potentially enhancing support for early\ndiagnosis.",

We introduce Outlier-Safe\nPre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier\nformation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key\ninnovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while\nmaintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing\nchannel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,\nredistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We\nvalidate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is\nthe first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive\n4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10\nbenchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%\ntraining overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis\n(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally\naltering LLM quantization behavior.

        "abstract": "Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce\nthe memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).\nNevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV\ncache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel\nframework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the\nKV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment\nresults demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,\nSKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves\nsignificantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,\nwith only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of\n4.73.",

While recent work in efficient\nreasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it\nremains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the\nintuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model\nresponses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether\nefficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To\nsystematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to\nmeasure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across\ntask settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned\nbehavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and\nself-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,\nwe find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than\nsmaller ones, they all display widespread \"scheming\" behaviors, including\nself-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning\ncues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies\nsuch as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three\ndefined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient\nreasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative\nto ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading\neffective supervision.",

While current Transformer-based language\nmodels have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,\nthey often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work\ninvestigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised\nwithin the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a\ncomplete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based\nlanguage VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a\nsupporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The\nexperiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under\nexplicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -\ncan be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation\nresults in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior\nknowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the\nmodel to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on\nKey. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into\ndecoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning\ntasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance\nbeyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at\npreserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.",

MSR-Align\nsupports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies\nacross both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes\nmultimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering\nusing strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nfine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both\ntextual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing\ngeneral reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective\nfoundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our\ndataset is made publicly available at\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/Leigest/MSR-Align.",

        "abstract": "Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's\nunderstanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid\nadvancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to\nmisleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted\nand sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer\nreview. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer\nrobust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are\nmade.This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a\ndedicated \"Refutations and Critiques\" (R & C) Track. This R & C Track would\nprovide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that\ncritically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic\nself-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including\ntrack design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an\nillustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude\nthat ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML\nresearch self-correct.",

Despite their differences in workflows, existing\nLLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent\ncommunication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,\nit also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample\nits continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the\nother model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to\ntransfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers\nboth natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from\none agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find\nthat the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can\nbetter reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we\npropose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition\ntrajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE\nachieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols,\nparticularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning.

However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning\ncreates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all\nprevious ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that\nanalyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to\nunderstanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution\nmethods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual\nimportance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the\nmodel generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box\nmethod of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which\nidentified \"broadcasting\" sentences that receive disproportionate attention\nfrom all future sentences via \"receiver\" attention heads; (3) a causal\nattribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by\nsuppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each\nfuture sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of\nthought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that\ndisproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought\nanchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an\nopen-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our\nmethods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods\nthat map how a model performs multi-step reasoning.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,\nundermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation\nmethods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic\nvariability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose\nFiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to\nevaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences\nin long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on\nsentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis\nby operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the\nconsistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into\nsemantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to\ncompare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of\nsubtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and\nvalidate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,\nrace, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced\nbiases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming\nvarious evaluation metrics.",

        "title": "Broken Tokens? Your Language Model can Secretly Handle Non-Canonical Tokenizations",
        "abstract": "Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single\n\"canonical\" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many\nnon-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we\ninvestigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical\ntokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated\nacross 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%\nof their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and\n90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models\ntend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs\nfarther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify\nsettings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,\nfinding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code\nunderstanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances\nlarge-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this\nrobustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show\nthat while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of\nnon-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base\nmodels try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical\noutput, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall,\nour findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than\npreviously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization\nat inference time to boost performance.",

        "title": "Mirage of Mastery: Memorization Tricks LLMs into Artificially Inflated Self-Knowledge",
        "abstract": "When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it\ncreates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization\nand self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an\nintertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our\nstudy, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn\nreasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume\ncompetence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our\nanalysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence\nfrom memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning\nability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility\nassessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task\nperturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains,\nwhich tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming\nour approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows\nflaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for\ntechniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of\ntheir own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness.
