        "abstract": "Medical visual question answering (MedVQA) plays a vital role in clinical\ndecision-making by providing contextually rich answers to image-based queries.\nAlthough vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they\noften generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation\naddresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but\nrisks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning\ncapabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing\napproaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment.\nHowever, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is\nparticularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel\nmultimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions\nand optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the\nquery and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information.\nConsequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to\naugment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation\ndemonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets,\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%.

Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES)\nenables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but\nis computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies\nTIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object\nsegmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework,\ncomprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second\nstage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model\n(MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract\nregion-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable\nonline retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and\ngenerate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate\nour approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements\nin both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.",

        "title": "Learning to Rank with Variable Result Presentation Lengths",
        "abstract": "Learning to Rank (LTR) methods generally assume that each document in a top-K\nranking is presented in an equal format. However, previous work has shown that\nusers' perceptions of relevance can be changed by varying presentations, i.e.,\nallocating more vertical space to some documents to provide additional textual\nor image information. Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect\nattention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when\nscrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a\nfixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been\naddressed by existing LTR methods.\n  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking\ntask, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation\nlength is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show\nthat this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability\nranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem\ncannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.\n  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient\nestimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths.\nOur semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the\nexpected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best\nperformance across different ranking settings. Furthermore, we observe that\neven simple length-aware methods can achieve significant performance\nimprovements over fixed-length models. Altogether, our theoretical and\nempirical results highlight the importance and difficulties of combining\ndocument presentation with LTR.",

We present\nNaviX, a native vector index for graph DBMSs (GDBMSs) that has two main design\ngoals. First, we aim to implement a disk-based vector index that leverages the\ncore storage and query-processing capabilities of the underlying GDBMS. To this\nend, NaviX is built on the Hierarchical Navigable Small-World (HNSW) graph,\nwhich itself is a graph-based structure. Second, we aim to support\npredicate-agnostic filtered vector search queries, in which the k nearest\nneighbors (kNNs) of a query vector vQ are searched only within an arbitrary\nsubset S of vectors defined by an ad-hoc selection sub-query QS. We adopt a\nprefiltering approach that evaluates QS first and passes the full description\nof subset S to the kNN search operator. We study how to design a prefiltering\nsearch algorithm that remains robust under varying selectivities and under\ndifferent correlations between subset S and query vector vQ. We propose an\nadaptive algorithm that uses the local selectivity of each vector in the HNSW\ngraph to choose an appropriate heuristic at every iteration of the kNN search.\nFinally, We demonstrate NaviX's robustness and efficiency through extensive\nexperiments against both existing prefiltering- and postfiltering-based\nbaselines.",

To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding\nalgorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations\nin response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.\n  This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating\nincremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for\nthe information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work\nwith word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media.\nThe library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as\nSkip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized\nframework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network\ntraining. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static\nword embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to\na streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different\nhyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is\navailable at https://github.com/dccuchile/rivertext.",

        "abstract": "While Text-to-SQL enables natural language interaction with structured\ndatabases, its effectiveness diminishes with unstructured data or ambiguous\nqueries due to rigid syntax and limited expressiveness. Concurrently, vector\nsearch has emerged as a powerful paradigm for semantic retrieval, particularly\nfor unstructured data. However, existing VectorSQL implementations still rely\nheavily on manual crafting and lack tailored evaluation frameworks, leaving a\nsignificant gap between theoretical potential and practical deployment. To\nbridge these complementary paradigms, we introduces Text2VectorSQL, a novel\nframework unifying Text-to-SQL and vector search to overcome expressiveness\nconstraints and support more diverse and holistical natural language queries.\nSpecifically, Text2VectorSQL enables semantic filtering, multi-modal matching,\nand retrieval acceleration. For evaluation, we build vector index on\nappropriate columns, extend user queries with semantic search, and annotate\nground truths via an automatic pipeline with expert review. Furthermore, we\ndevelop dedicated Text2VectorSQL models with synthetic data, demonstrating\nsignificant performance improvements over baseline methods. Our work\nestablishes the foundation for the Text2VectorSQL task, paving the way for more\nversatile and intuitive database interfaces.

Beyond illustrating this link, we show how\ndispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring\nlabeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to\npredict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for\nmodel selection.

        "abstract": "In music information retrieval (MIR), contrastive self-supervised learning\nfor general-purpose representation models is effective for global tasks such as\nautomatic tagging. However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is\nwidely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised\nmodels are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g.,\nmasked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the\npotential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We\nconsider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the\ntime--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL\nthrough normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although\nNT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks\nto weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence\ntokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens\noffers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful\nproperties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform\nunexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore,\nhigh-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention\nmaps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different\nmusical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but\nadvances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some\noverlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence\nmodeling in MIR.",

The retrieval stage plays a\ncritical role in generating a high-recall set of candidate items that covers a\nwide range of diverse user interests. Effectively covering the diverse and\nlong-tail user interests within this stage poses a significant challenge:\ntraditional two-tower models struggle in this regard due to limited user-item\nfeature interaction and often bias towards top use cases. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel multi-embedding retrieval framework designed to\nenhance user interest representation by generating multiple user embeddings\nconditioned on both implicit and explicit user interests. Implicit interests\nare captured from user history through a Differentiable Clustering Module\n(DCM), whereas explicit interests, such as topics that the user has followed,\nare modeled via Conditional Retrieval (CR). These methodologies represent a\nform of conditioned user representation learning that involves condition\nrepresentation construction and associating the target item with the relevant\nconditions. Synergizing implicit and explicit user interests serves as a\ncomplementary approach to achieve more effective and comprehensive candidate\nretrieval as they benefit on different user segments and extract conditions\nfrom different but supplementary sources.

Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)\nand agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs\nwith knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly\nimplemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved\nknowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge\neffectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do\nsuch generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to\nfinetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific\ndata, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called\nknowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2\ndataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive\nknowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT\ntechniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency\nin analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter\nsubstantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation.

        "abstract": "The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate\nspeech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.\nDetecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent\ncode-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content\non social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is\ntypically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource\nlanguages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,\nhigh-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this\nlimitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on\nlow-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -\nzero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot\nprompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to\ndetect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the\nmetaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that\nmarks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We\ninvestigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and\ncompare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,\nWord2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer\nperceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated\nrecurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in\nthe low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource\nlanguage - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The\nperformance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and\nenvironmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity\nusage, and computational time.",

To tackle this challenge, we\npropose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA)\nthat addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns.\nSpecifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring\na manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user\nneeds and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through\nThought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts\nhigh-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover,\nwe designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries\nof different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific\ndatasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets,\nTAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods.\nNotably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while\ngeneralizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in\nmanaging complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems.

Our CAR, for the $\\textit{first time}$, incorporates semantics\n(SIDs) and behavior (UID) into a single autoregressive transformer from an\n``act-with-think'' dual perspective via chunk-level autoregression.\nSpecifically, CAR packs SIDs and UID into a conceptual chunk for item unified\nrepresentation, allowing each decoding step to make a holistic prediction.\nExperiments show that our CAR significantly outperforms existing methods based\non traditional AR, improving Recall@5 by 7.93% to 22.30%. Furthermore, we\nverify the scaling effect between model performance and SIDs bit number,\ndemonstrating that CAR preliminary emulates a kind of slow-thinking style\nmechanism akin to the reasoning processes observed in large language models\n(LLMs).",

        "abstract": "Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications\nrequiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods\nprimarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation\nsignificantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement\nlearning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam\nsearch modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to\nensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided\nDiverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances\nquality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal\ndirectional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased\nprobability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using\nadaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality\nthresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD\nconsistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by\n1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15%\nwhile increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.",

To\noperationalize similarity to previous research, we introduce two complementary\nmetrics to characterize the local geometry of a publication's semantic\nneighborhood: (1) \\emph{density} ($\\rho$), defined as the ratio between a fixed\nnumber of previously-published papers and the minimum distance enclosing those\npapers in a semantic embedding space, and (2) asymmetry ($\\alpha$), defined as\nthe average directional difference between a paper and its nearest neighbors.\nWe tested the predictive relationship between these two metrics and its\nsubsequent citation rate using a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach,\nsurveying $\\sim 53,000$ publications across nine academic disciplines and five\ndifferent document embeddings. While the individual effects of $\\rho$ on\ncitation count are small and variable, incorporating density-based predictors\nconsistently improves out-of-sample prediction when added to baseline models.\nThese results suggest that the density of a paper's surrounding scientific\nliterature may carry modest but informative signals about its eventual impact.\nMeanwhile, we find no evidence that publication asymmetry improves model\npredictions of citation rates.

However, existing autonomous\ndatabase platforms are limited in their capabilities, primarily addressing\nsingle-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning.

This innovative solution is designed not only to\nassist developers in writing efficient SQL queries but also to provide\ncomprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit\nabnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire\nmaintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of\nmetrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes,\nand invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully\nimplemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry,\nwhere it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance\nscenarios.

We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that\nquantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss\ndecrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input\nrelevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it\ncaptures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving\nreliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual\nalignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output\ncalibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance\non labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings\nand reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.\nFurther analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model\ncapabilities critical to ICL success.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can\ndevelop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable\nrewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and\ndomain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework\nwhere models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously\nimproving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.\nThrough self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively\nchallenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple\nNegotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct\nreasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model\n(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These\nresults demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable\nreasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous\nreasoning development.",

However,\nconstructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets\nfor supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the \\underline{\\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided\n\\underline{\\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which\nfacilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across\nvarious languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows\nfine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity\nand comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform\nsupervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those\ntrained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on\nTaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an\nopen-source dataset that is 180 times larger.",

        "abstract": "This work investigates the challenging task of identifying narrative roles -\nHero, Villain, Victim, and Other - in Internet memes, across three diverse test\nsets spanning English and code-mixed (English-Hindi) languages. Building on an\nannotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more\nbalanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of\nthe CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses\nhighlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real\nmemes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits\nexplicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task,\nwe evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual\ntransformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs,\nand multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot\nsettings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like\nDeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent\nchallenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across\ncultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to\nguide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured\ninstructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements.\nOur findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt\nengineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in\nvisual-textual content.",
