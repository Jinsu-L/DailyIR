        "abstract": "Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents\n(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled\ndata. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,\nparticularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,\nwe propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to\nautonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.\nSpecifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel\nsoftware environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new\nsoftware, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle\nauto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we\ndesign a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a\nCurriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.\nThe agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of\nadversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist\ntraining strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from\nspecialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA\ncapable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately\nachieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on\ntheir specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across\nfive novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a\nsignificant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a\ncompetitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.",

However, continual fine-tuning\nLLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\ncharacterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and\n2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled\nexperiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies\nunder the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via\nKL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses.

Recently, generative recommendation\nhas emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional\nretrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic\ngeneration. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained\nby their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from\ntwo critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking\na coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement\n(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that\nlearns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core\ninnovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict\nhierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for\neach recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE\nincorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space\noverlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but\nalso promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive\nutilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled\nIDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models.

        "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines\ninto conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant\nindustrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time\nneeds and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated\ncontent like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static\npages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such\ntime-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static\ncontent, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like\ndatabases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA\n(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage\nframework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content\nand dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an\nIntent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information\nsources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task\nPlanner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for\noptimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for\nefficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge\nthe gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI\nsearch product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic\nframework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency\ndemands of a large-scale industrial system.",

However, their\nrapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly\nunsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis\nthat threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and\ncommunity well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically,\nwith per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to\nover 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a\nsingle conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3)\npsychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative\nsentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically,\nwith attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace\nvenue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its\ncore mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC)\nmodel, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally\ncoordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable,\ninclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their\nhigh computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.\nExisting compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.\nlow-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered\nstructure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a\ndimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by\ndictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight\nsharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection\nmatrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's\nparameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods\nrequiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in\nAttention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers\n- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix\natoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves\nbetter benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),\nlow-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at\ncomparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the\ndictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing\ncross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),\nMASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks\nwith 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning\nstrategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for\nparameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we\ninvestigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce\ntheir number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their\nperformance.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal Recommender Systems aim to improve recommendation accuracy by\nintegrating heterogeneous content, such as images and textual metadata. While\neffective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal\nunderstanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of\nmultimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the\nrepresentations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard\nextractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on\nmodality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over\ncross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via\nstructured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations\nwithout requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable\nperformance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive\nadvantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling\ndirect assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are\nincorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve\nrecommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and\nalignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of\nsemantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling\nfoundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in\nrecommendation tasks.",

        "abstract": "As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal\ncapabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from\nthe hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual\ninput. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of\ntraining data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which\nconsists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs\nwith certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we\nfind that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage\ntheir training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during\ntraining. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often\nincorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand\nthis issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,\nrevealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling\n(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and\nlightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via\ntraining bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between\nground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias\nand adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only\nupdates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\\%\nof the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both\ndiscriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong\nscalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data\nvolume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond\nobject-level hallucination.

We train a range of classical models to quantify how different\ntasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the\neffectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform\npsychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in\nrealistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning\nprocess with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic\nperformance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score.

Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting\nstyle signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the\nmodel's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer\ncorrectness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.\nWe attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions\nin certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that\npreserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates\nthe style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation\nspace via an orthogonal deflation process.

By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each\nsubspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to\nmaintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness.

TRAIL enables LLM agents to iteratively explore,\nupdate, and refine knowledge graphs during the reasoning process, employing a\nconfidence-driven mechanism for the generation, validation, and pruning of new\nfacts. This plug-and-play architecture facilitates seamless integration with\nvarious LLMs, supporting continual adaptation without the need for retraining.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms\nexisting KG-augmented and retrieval-augmented LLM baselines by 3% to 13%. More\nimportantly, these results represent a significant step toward developing\nadaptive, memory-augmented language models capable of continual learning and\nreliable, transparent reasoning.",

It\nhighlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the\nsignificant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,\nespecially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research\nintroduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1\nMathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's\nGPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain\nframework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official\ncurriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching\nplan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess\nthe generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic\nTextual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified\nthrough a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results\ndemonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded\nprompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and\nfactual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of\nimplementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a\nmanual pipeline.

This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing\nthe epistemological challenge of \"creation without understanding\" that\ncharacterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology.

First,\nthe current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when\nfine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\\% F1.\nSecond, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,\nsome lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent\nperformance.

To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods\nsolely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the\ncomplementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to\ntackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally\nand simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.\nThese designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video\nmoment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or\nbackground sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,\nwe propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which\nlearns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts\nfor VMR.

However, very few approaches model the\nflow of time explicitly.\n  This paper analyzes how time can be encoded in factorization-style\nrecommendation models. By including absolute time as a feature, our models can\nlearn varying user preferences and changing item perception over time. In\naddition to simple binning approaches, we also propose a novel, fully\ncontinuous time encoding mechanism.

Empirical results show that, by explicitly modeling time,\nour models are very effective at capturing temporal signals, such as varying\nitem popularities over time.

        "abstract": "Taxonomies and ontologies of research topics (e.g., MeSH, UMLS, CSO, NLM)\nplay a central role in providing the primary framework through which\nintelligent systems can explore and interpret the literature. However, these\nresources have traditionally been manually curated, a process that is\ntime-consuming, prone to obsolescence, and limited in granularity. This paper\npresents Sci-OG, a semi-auto\\-mated methodology for generating research topic\nontologies, employing a multi-step approach: 1) Topic Discovery, extracting\npotential topics from research papers; 2) Relationship Classification,\ndetermining semantic relationships between topic pairs; and 3) Ontology\nConstruction, refining and organizing topics into a structured ontology. The\nrelationship classification component, which constitutes the core of the\nsystem, integrates an encoder-based language model with features describing\ntopic occurrence in the scientific literature. We evaluate this approach\nagainst a range of alternative solutions using a dataset of 21,649 manually\nannotated semantic triples. Our method achieves the highest F1 score (0.951),\nsurpassing various competing approaches, including a fine-tuned SciBERT model\nand several LLM baselines, such as the fine-tuned GPT4-mini. Our work is\ncorroborated by a use case which illustrates the practical application of our\nsystem to extend the CSO ontology in the area of cybersecurity.

Built on MovieLens and MMTF-14K,\nit aligns dense item embeddings from three modalities: audio (block-level,\ni-vector), visual (CNN, AVF), and text. Missing or sparse metadata is\nautomatically enriched using state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., OpenAI Ada),\ngenerating high-quality synopses for thousands of movies. All text (raw or\naugmented) is embedded with configurable encoders (Ada, LLaMA-2, Sentence-T5),\nproducing multiple ready-to-use sets. The pipeline supports interchangeable\nearly-, mid-, and late-fusion (concatenation, PCA, CCA, rank-aggregation) and\nmultiple backbones (MF, VAECF, VBPR, AMR, VMF) for ablation. Experiments are\nfully declarative via a single YAML file. Evaluation spans accuracy (Recall,\nnDCG) and beyond-accuracy metrics: cold-start rate, coverage, novelty,\ndiversity, fairness. Results show LLM-based augmentation and strong text\nembeddings boost cold-start and coverage, especially when fused with\naudio-visual features.

In this paper, we propose a formal\ncharacterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to\nevaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature\nof deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but\nrather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,\nbroad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we\ndefine DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims\nuncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level\nreport generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging\nbenchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,\ndatasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events\n(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1\nscore ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model\nperforms the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55.

Existing studies show that incorporating search signals boosts\nrecommendation performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods relies\nheavily on rich search interactions. They primarily benefit a small subset of\nusers with abundant search behavior, while offering limited improvements for\nthe majority of users who exhibit only sparse search activity. To address the\nproblem of sparse search data in search-enhanced recommendation, we face two\nkey challenges: (1) how to learn useful search features for users with sparse\nsearch interactions, and (2) how to design effective training objectives under\nsparse conditions. Our idea is to leverage the features of users with rich\nsearch interactions to enhance those of users with sparse search interactions.\nBased on this idea, we propose GSERec, a method that utilizes message passing\non the User-Code Graphs to alleviate data sparsity in Search-Enhanced\nRecommendation. Specifically, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) with\nvector quantization to generate discrete codes, which connect similar users and\nthereby construct the graph. Through message passing on this graph, embeddings\nof users with rich search data are propagated to enhance the embeddings of\nusers with sparse interactions. To further ensure that the message passing\ncaptures meaningful information from truly similar users, we introduce a\ncontrastive loss to better model user similarities. The enhanced user\nrepresentations are then integrated into downstream search-enhanced\nrecommendation models.

While these\ntools support helpful applications, they also raise serious concerns by making\nit possible to generate convincing fake speech in many languages. Current\nresearch has largely focused on detecting fake speech, but little attention has\nbeen given to tracing the source models used to generate it. This paper\nintroduces the first benchmark for multilingual speech deepfake source tracing,\ncovering both mono- and cross-lingual scenarios. We comparatively investigate\nDSP- and SSL-based modeling; examine how SSL representations fine-tuned on\ndifferent languages impact cross-lingual generalization performance; and\nevaluate generalization to unseen languages and speakers. Our findings offer\nthe first comprehensive insights into the challenges of identifying speech\ngeneration models when training and inference languages differ.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the\nintroduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging\nrule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions\nand guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we\nincorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances\nlocal advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic\ntransitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method\nintroduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization\nstrategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains\non multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed\nframework's robustness and general applicability.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for\nenhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However,\ncurrent RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently\nretrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be\nresolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk\nretrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information\nsignals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive\nInformation Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that\nintegrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether\nto retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs\na dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer\nand a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these\noutputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically\nimproving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a\ndual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and\nself-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information\nSelection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to\nboth sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance\nefficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy\nthrough contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.\nExperimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS\nreduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)\nwhile still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior\nbaselines on average.",

In this paper, we observe that the controllability of\ntexts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to\ndecline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises\nfrom the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different\ntypes of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors\ninfluencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight\nand effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA)\nbased on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first\nselects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify\nthe attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance\ncontrollability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence\nlength increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar\naugmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text\nquality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text\nsatisfies the attribute constraints well.

Traditional methods often yield incomplete\nsegmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class\nrepresentations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging\nclass-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations\nand a neglect of target structural information.\n  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network\n(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete\nground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its\nvariant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key\nmodules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures\nsemantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract\nunbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure\nCoordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,\nstructure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic\ncognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the\nsemantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.\nFinally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic\nstep-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between\nclasses.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.

        "abstract": "Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group\nbehavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must\npromote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social\nrelationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be\nsensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual\ngoal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need\nfor intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators\ncreate a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social\nexchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group\nand providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but \"black\nbox\" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this\nimportant demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal\nmeeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's\nreasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes\ndecisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and\nsentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is\na transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of\nan FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system\nsignificantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for\nintervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.\nCritically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes\nacross different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior\nhuman facilitators to improve the performance of novices.

While RAG\nmethods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation\nmodels, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge\nunderexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with\ngeneralization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and\nmodel-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID\ndynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach\nutilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with\ncategory-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further\nintegrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the\nquery, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID\ngenerates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images\nfrom a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched\ninput for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the\nUniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that\nRAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.\nRAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining\nhigh accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG\ncompression.

We devise an offline evaluation\nprotocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is\nagnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of\nthis framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of\nalgorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and\nplasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible\ntrade-off between stability and plasticity.Although additional experiments will\nbe necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the\nusefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics\nof recommendation models.",

Evaluated on the real-world PENS\ndataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.\nNotably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over\nstrong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing\npersonalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1\n26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations,\nand sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component\nand the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve\na superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news\nheadline generation.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)\noften struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks.\nWhile augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition,\nthey remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions\nthrough GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this\nwork, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use\ncoding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system\nthat synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic\nexecution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks\nto either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which\ncan write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the\nagent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management\nand data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.\nWe evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1\nachieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly\noutperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves\nefficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to\njust 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that\nintegrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and\nscalable path toward generalized computer automation.",

Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains\nlimited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing\nchallenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address\nthis, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that\nexplains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing\npredictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint\ncross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly\nparameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and\nfeature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures\nexplanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable\nmeaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between\nnetworks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA\nexplanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics\ntailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and\nefficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA\nmodels.",

        "abstract": "Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language\nmodels (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks\nsuch as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation.\nReinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent\nagents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly\nthrough social interactions. However, social interactions have two key\ncharacteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,\nwhere utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit\nassignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as\nrapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal\nachievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL\nwith single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines\ncoarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.\nUtterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by\nattributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards\ncapture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.\nExperiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate\nthat Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17\non Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing\napproaches.

The review emphasizes\nthe need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting\nstrategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of\nthe recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and\nmitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction\ntuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG\nframeworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the\nvalue of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance\nof domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the\nreview underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate\nand explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking.

        "abstract": "The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world\napplications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating\nharmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques\nhave emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages\ninto generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that\nimproves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects\npreferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a\nlarger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that\nrely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a\nclustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even\nwhen the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and\ndecoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the\nmessage into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically\ndecode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text\nand improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs\ndemonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and\ntext generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.",
