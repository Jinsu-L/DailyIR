        "abstract": "CLAX is a JAX-based library that implements classic click models using modern\ngradient-based optimization. While neural click models have emerged over the\npast decade, complex click models based on probabilistic graphical models\n(PGMs) have not systematically adopted gradient-based optimization, preventing\npractitioners from leveraging modern deep learning frameworks while preserving\nthe interpretability of classic models. CLAX addresses this gap by replacing\nEM-based optimization with direct gradient-based optimization in a numerically\nstable manner. The framework's modular design enables the integration of any\ncomponent, from embeddings and deep networks to custom modules, into classic\nclick models for end-to-end optimization. We demonstrate CLAX's efficiency by\nrunning experiments on the full Baidu-ULTR dataset comprising over a billion\nuser sessions in $\\approx$ 2 hours on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster\nthan traditional EM approaches. CLAX implements ten classic click models,\nserving both industry practitioners seeking to understand user behavior and\nimprove ranking performance at scale and researchers developing new click\nmodels.

        "abstract": "Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward\nunseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design.",

While x86-based architectures have historically dominated this\ndomain, the increasing adoption of ARM-based servers in industry presents a\ncritical need for ANNS solutions optimized on ARM architectures. A naive port\nof existing x86 ANNS algorithms to ARM platforms results in a substantial\nperformance deficit, failing to leverage the unique capabilities of the\nunderlying hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce KScaNN, a novel\nANNS algorithm co-designed for the Kunpeng 920 ARM architecture. KScaNN\nembodies a holistic approach that synergizes sophisticated, data aware\nalgorithmic refinements with carefully-designed hardware specific\noptimizations. Its core contributions include: 1) novel algorithmic techniques,\nincluding a hybrid intra-cluster search strategy and an improved PQ residual\ncalculation method, which optimize the search process at a higher level; 2) an\nML-driven adaptive search module that provides adaptive, per-query tuning of\nsearch parameters, eliminating the inefficiencies of static configurations; and\n3) highly-optimized SIMD kernels for ARM that maximize hardware utilization for\nthe critical distance computation workloads. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that KScaNN not only closes the performance gap but establishes a\nnew standard, achieving up to a 1.63x speedup over the fastest x86-based\nsolution.

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of open-access (OA) publications has intensified the\nchallenge of identifying relevant scientific papers. Due to privacy constraints\nand limited access to user interaction data, recent efforts have shifted toward\ncontent-based recommendation, which relies solely on textual information.\nHowever, existing models typically treat papers as unstructured text,\nneglecting their discourse organization and thereby limiting semantic\ncompleteness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose\nOMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective,\nMethod, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning,\nand structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style\nsummarization module converts raw papers into structured and\ndiscourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives\nalign semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels.\nThe final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through\ncontextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly\nconstructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in\nPrecision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that\nQA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete\nrepresentations. Overall, OMRC-MR provides a unified and interpretable\ncontent-based paradigm for scientific paper recommendation, advancing\ntrustworthy and privacy-aware scholarly information retrieval.",

Therefore, we introduce ARC (Agent\nRAG Cache Mechanism), a novel, annotation-free caching framework that\ndynamically manages small, high-value corpora for each agent. By synthesizing\nhistorical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached\nitems in the embedding space, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance\ncache. With comprehensive experiments on three retrieval datasets, our\nexperimental results demonstrate that ARC reduces storage requirements to\n0.015% of the original corpus while offering up to 79.8% has-answer rate and\nreducing average retrieval latency by 80%.

GAMER introduces a cross-level interaction\nlayer to capture hierarchical dependencies among behaviors and a sequential\naugmentation strategy that enhances robustness in training.

        "title": "Two thousand years of the oracle problem. Insights from Ancient Delphi on the future of blockchain oracles",
        "abstract": "The oracle problem refers to the inability of an agent to know if the\ninformation coming from an oracle is authentic and unbiased. In ancient times,\nphilosophers and historians debated on how to evaluate, increase, and secure\nthe reliability of oracle predictions, particularly those from Delphi, which\npertained to matters of state. Today, we refer to data carriers for automatic\nmachines as oracles, but establishing a secure channel between these oracles\nand the real world still represents a challenge. Despite numerous efforts, this\nproblem remains mostly unsolved, and the recent advent of blockchain oracles\nhas added a layer of complexity because of the decentralization of blockchains.\nThis paper conceptually connects Delphic and modern blockchain oracles,\ndeveloping a comparative framework. Leveraging blockchain oracle taxonomy,\nlexical analysis is also performed on 167 Delphic queries to shed light on the\nrelationship between oracle answer quality and question type. The presented\nframework aims first at revealing commonalities between classical and\ncomputational oracles and then at enriching the oracle analysis within each\nfield. This study contributes to the computer science literature by proposing\nstrategies to improve the reliability of blockchain oracles based on insights\nfrom Delphi and to classical literature by introducing a framework that can\nalso be applied to interpret and classify other ancient oracular mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across various\napplications, yet their potential security and ethical risks have raised\nincreasing concerns. Existing research employs red teaming evaluations,\nutilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs.\nHowever, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue\ntrajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the\nconsiderable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these\nlimitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on\ndynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process\nas a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an\nenhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a\ncollaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees. This\nalgorithm significantly improves the efficiency of optimal attack path search\nwhile substantially reducing the average number of queries required. Empirical\nevaluations on three open-source and two proprietary language models\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates\nabove 90\\% across the board, with a peak of 98\\% on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and\noutperforming existing baselines.

However, during\nmemory storage and retrieval, these systems frequently exhibit memory\nhallucinations, including fabrication, errors, conflicts, and omissions.\nExisting evaluations of memory hallucinations are primarily end-to-end question\nanswering, which makes it difficult to localize the operational stage within\nthe memory system where hallucinations arise. To address this, we introduce the\nHallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level\nhallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines\nthree evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question\nanswering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different\noperational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct\nuser-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and\nHaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type\nquestions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns,\nwith context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations\nacross different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based\non HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate\nhallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently\npropagate errors to the question answering stage. Future research should focus\non developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that\nsystematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.",

        "abstract": "Safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly\nwidespread, especially in sensitive applications where fairness is essential\nand biased outputs can cause significant harm. However, evaluating the fairness\nof models is a complex challenge, and approaches that do so typically utilize\nstandard question-answer (QA) styled schemes. Such methods often overlook\ndeeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive\nfairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work,\nwe introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences\nencoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by\nsafety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases\noften relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which\npresent limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with\nadditional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to\nuncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals\nduring QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects,\npresenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future\ndevelopment of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment\ntraining. We demonstrate our approach over multiple LLMs, where our findings\nexpose an alarming distinction between models' direct responses and their\nunderlying fairness issues.",

If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not\ntraverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps\nshould bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.\nTo test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence\nand the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a\nfull paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and\nlayers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat\nangles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality\nor chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe\ndeflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,\nmeaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm\nattention-induced curvature.",

The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods\nthat are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet,\nthe rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards\ncan be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses\nthis challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the\nmultiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct\nconcepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking\nCategorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods\naccording to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,\nduring, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2)\nWatermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping\neach criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and\ndetectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since\ninteroperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we\npropose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking\nComparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the\noperationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all\nfour standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further\nresearch into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture\nof LLMs.",

We propose QuestionRAG, a\nframework that tackles these problems. To address misinterpretation, it\nenriches the input with external knowledge (e.g., search results, related\nentities). To prevent over-correction, it uses reinforcement learning (RL) to\nalign the model's objective with precise correction, not just paraphrasing.

Furthermore, RL-based alignment proves significantly more\neffective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), boosting the model's\nability to follow instructions and generalize.

        "title": "Segmentation Beyond Defaults: Asymmetrical Byte Pair Encoding for Optimal Machine Translation Performance",
        "abstract": "Existing Machine Translation (MT) research often suggests a single, fixed set\nof hyperparameters for word segmentation models, symmetric Byte Pair Encoding\n(BPE), which applies the same number of merge operations (NMO) to train\ntokenizers for both source and target languages. However, we demonstrate that\nthis uniform approach doesn't guarantee optimal MT performance across different\nlanguage pairs and data sizes. This work investigates BPE segmentation recipes\nacross various data volumes and language pairs to evaluate MT system\nperformance. We find that utilizing asymmetric BPE, where the source and target\nlanguages have different NMOs, significantly improves results over the\nsymmetric approach, especially in low-resource settings (50K, 100K, and 500K\nsentence pairs). Specifically, asymmetric BPE yield statistically significant\n($p<0.05$) average gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ on English-Hindi in\nlow-resource setups. We validated this trend across six additional language\npairs (English and Telugu, Shona, Norwegian, Kyrgyz, Hausa, and Inuktitut),\nobserving statistically significant improvement in 10 out of 12 systems\ncompared to symmetric BPE. Our findings indicate a high NMO for the source (4K\nto 32K) and a low NMO for the target (0.5K to 2K) provides optimal results,\nparticularly benefiting low-resource MT.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across\nbenchmarks--from knowledge quizzes and math reasoning to web-agent tasks--but\nthese tests occur in static settings, lacking real dynamics and uncertainty.\nConsequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than\ndecision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce\nLiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in\nrealistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles:\n(i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on\noffline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing\nreal-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends\ncontrol from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk\nmanagement and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across\nstructurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction\nmarkets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each\nstep, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs\npercentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we\nrun 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1)\nhigh LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display\ndistinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and\n(3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These\nfindings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence,\nmotivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency\nunder live uncertainty.",

However, most\nexisting methods primarily compress verbose reasoning outputs. These\nLong-to-Short transformations aim to improve efficiency, but still rely on\nexplicit reasoning during inference. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{3TF}\n(\\textbf{T}hought-\\textbf{T}raining and \\textbf{T}hought-\\textbf{F}ree\ninference), a framework for efficient reasoning that takes a Short-to-Long\nperspective. We first train a hybrid model that can operate in both reasoning\nand non-reasoning modes, and then further train it on CoT-annotated data to\ninternalize structured reasoning, while enforcing concise, thought-free outputs\nat inference time using the no-reasoning mode. Unlike compression-based\napproaches, 3TF improves the reasoning quality of non-reasoning outputs,\nenabling models to perform rich internal reasoning implicitly while keeping\nexternal outputs short. Empirically, 3TF-trained models obtain large\nimprovements on reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference,\ndemonstrating that high quality reasoning can be learned and executed\nimplicitly without explicit step-by-step generation.",

In this work, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted to\nexamine the robustness and effectiveness of diverse UE measures regarding\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in LLMs. It involves twelve different UE\nmethods and four generation quality metrics including LLMScore from LLM\ncriticizers to evaluate the uncertainty of LLM-generated answers in\nQuestion-Answering (QA) tasks on both in-distribution (ID) and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Conversely, density-based methods and the P(True) metric exhibit\nsuperior performance in OOD contexts, highlighting their effectiveness in\ncapturing the model's epistemic uncertainty.

Yet, existing multimodal benchmarks either\noveremphasize textual reasoning or fall short of systematically capturing\nvision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving the cognitive capacity of MLLMs\ninsufficiently assessed. To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC\n(Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded\nbenchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three\nfundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and\nknowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs'\ncognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct\nextensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that\nclosed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs.\n30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak\n(less than or equal to 30%). We further identify common error patterns,\nincluding orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and\npoor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that\nChain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason ->\nverify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction.

        "title": "Beyond Citations: Measuring Idea-level Knowledge Diffusion from Research to Journalism and Policy-making",
        "abstract": "Despite the importance of social science knowledge for various stakeholders,\nmeasuring its diffusion into different domains remains a challenge. This study\nuses a novel text-based approach to measure the idea-level diffusion of social\nscience knowledge from the research domain to the journalism and policy-making\ndomains. By doing so, we expand the detection of knowledge diffusion beyond the\nmeasurements of direct references. Our study focuses on media effects theories\nas key research ideas in the field of communication science. Using 72,703\ndocuments (2000-2019) from three domains (i.e., research, journalism, and\npolicy-making) that mention these ideas, we count the mentions of these ideas\nin each domain, estimate their domain-specific contexts, and track and compare\ndifferences across domains and over time. Overall, we find that diffusion\npatterns and dynamics vary considerably between ideas, with some ideas\ndiffusing between other domains, while others do not. Based on the embedding\nregression approach, we compare contextualized meanings across domains and find\nthat the distances between research and policy are typically larger than\nbetween research and journalism. We also find that ideas largely shift roles\nacross domains - from being the theories themselves in research to sense-making\nin news to applied, administrative use in policy. Over time, we observe\nsemantic convergence mainly for ideas that are practically oriented. Our\nresults characterize the cross-domain diffusion patterns and dynamics of social\nscience knowledge at the idea level, and we discuss the implications for\nmeasuring knowledge diffusion beyond citations.",

The objective is to\nevaluate impactful GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive\nperformance, and specialization, and to identify promising approaches for\nadvanced modeling, data-intensive discovery, and integrative biological\nanalysis. RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics\nsubfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling),\nwhich demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern\nrecognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model\narchitectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to\ntargeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant\nbenefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data\nintegration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis.\nRQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and\nsynthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests\nthe main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that\nimpact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust\nevaluation and biologically grounded modeling.

This capability allows these models\nto engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating\na final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these\n\"dual-state\" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning\nprocesses of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical\ntasks.

We\nassessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and\nROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the\nthinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for\nthe majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as\nopen-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal,\nhighlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced\nmethods for medical knowledge integration.",

        "title": "SCALE: Upscaled Continual Learning of Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "We revisit continual pre-training for large language models and argue that\nprogress now depends more on scaling the right structure than on scaling\nparameters alone. We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that\ninserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all\npre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies\nand increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original\nfunctionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation,\nwhich maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented\ninitialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative\nAdaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to\nacquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as\nSCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and\nSCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing\nbetween preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography\nbenchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion\nwhile still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean\ncorpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and\ncompetitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best\noverall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when\npreservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and\nadaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning\nsetups.",

Despite its rapid\ngrowth and broad potential, ABSA research and resources remain concentrated in\ncommercial domains, leaving analytical needs unmet in high-demand yet\nlow-resource areas such as education and healthcare. Domain adaptation\nchallenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive\nin-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas.\nMoreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly\nrigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent\nthe performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through\nthree contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text\nSimilarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates\nrealistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation\nwith traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present\nthe first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs;\n<7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education\nreview ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and\nweight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask\nfine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling\n1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark\nresults with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first\npublic set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in\nlow-resource domains.",
