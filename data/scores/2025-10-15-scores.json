        "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require\naccess to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic\nand ever-changing real-world information in order to address\ninformation-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,\nsuch as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search\nequipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and\npoorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and\nsuboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,\nthe first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web\nsearches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.\nSpecifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops\nof the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively\nadapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling\nself-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an\nonline reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce\nDeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated\npipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This\ndataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual\ninformation, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which\nsearch tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct\nextensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results\nand provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.",

        "abstract": "With the rise of modern search and recommendation platforms, insufficient\ncollaborative information of cold-start items exacerbates the Matthew effect of\nexisting platform items, challenging platform diversity and becoming a\nlongstanding issue. Existing methods align items' side content with\ncollaborative information to transfer collaborative signals from\nhigh-popularity items to cold-start items. However, these methods fail to\naccount for the asymmetry between collaboration and content, nor the\nfine-grained differences among items. To address these issues, we propose\nSMILE, an item representation enhancement approach based on fused alignment of\nsemantic IDs. Specifically, we use RQ-OPQ encoding to quantize item content and\ncollaborative information, followed by a two-step alignment: RQ encoding\ntransfers shared collaborative signals across items, while OPQ encoding learns\ndifferentiated information of items. Comprehensive offline experiments on\nlarge-scale industrial datasets demonstrate superiority of SMILE, and rigorous\nonline A/B tests confirm statistically significant improvements: item CTR\n+1.66%, buyers +1.57%, and order volume +2.17%.",

        "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally\nshifted recommender systems from discriminative to generative paradigms, where\nuser behavior modeling is achieved by generating target items conditioned on\nhistorical interactions. Yet current generative recommenders still suffer from\ntwo core limitations: the lack of high-quality negative modeling and the\nreliance on implicit rewards. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards\n(RLVR) offers a natural solution by enabling on-policy sampling of harder\nnegatives and grounding optimization in explicit reward signals. However,\napplying RLVR to generative recommenders remains non-trivial. Its unique\ngeneration space often leads to invalid or repetitive items that undermine\nsampling efficiency, and ranking supervision is sparse since most items receive\nidentical zero rewards. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforced\nPreference Optimization for Recommendation (ReRe), a reinforcement-based\nparadigm tailored to LLM-based recommenders, an important direction in\ngenerative recommendation. ReRe incorporates constrained beam search to improve\nsampling efficiency and diversify hard negatives, while augmenting rule-based\naccuracy rewards with auxiliary ranking rewards for finer-grained supervision.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that ReRe\nconsistently outperforms both traditional and LLM-based recommenders in ranking\nperformance. Further analysis shows that ReRe not only enhances performance\nacross both base and SFT-initialized models but also generalizes robustly\nacross different backbone families and scales. Beyond empirical gains, we\nsystematically investigate the design space of RLVR in recommendation across\ngeneration, sampling strategy, reward modeling, and optimization algorithm,\noffering insights for future research.",

In this study, we explore the implications of the MaxSim operator on\nthe gradient flows of the training of multi-vector models and show that such a\nsimple linear projection has inherent, if non-critical, limitations in this\nsetting. We then discuss the theoretical improvements that could result from\nreplacing this single-layer projection with well-studied alternative\nfeedforward linear networks (FFN), such as deeper, non-linear FFN blocks, GLU\nblocks, and skip-connections, could alleviate these limitations. Through the\ndesign and systematic evaluation of alternate projection blocks, we show that\nbetter-designed final projections positively impact the downstream performance\nof ColBERT models. We highlight that many projection variants outperform the\noriginal linear projections, with the best-performing variants increasing\naverage performance on a range of retrieval benchmarks across domains by over 2\nNDCG@10 points. We then conduct further exploration on the individual\nparameters of these projections block in order to understand what drives this\nempirical performance, highlighting the particular importance of upscaled\nintermediate projections and residual connections. As part of these ablation\nstudies, we show that numerous suboptimal projection variants still outperform\nthe traditional single-layer projection across multiple benchmarks, confirming\nour hypothesis.

However, the misuse of LLMs\nwith such powerful capabilities can lead to even greater risks. This is\nespecially concerning in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive domains such as\nbiosecurity, where DR can generate a professional report containing detailed\nforbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, we have found such risks in practice:\nsimply submitting a harmful query, which a standalone LLM directly rejects, can\nelicit a detailed and dangerous report from DR agents. This highlights the\nelevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet,\njailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks,\nas they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap,\nwe propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects\nmalicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes\nharmful queries as academic research questions. We conducted extensive\nexperiments across different LLMs and various safety benchmarks, including\ngeneral and biosecurity forbidden prompts. These experiments reveal 3 key\nfindings: (1) Alignment of the LLMs often fail in DR agents, where harmful\nprompts framed in academic terms can hijack agent intent; (2) Multi-step\nplanning and execution weaken the alignment, revealing systemic vulnerabilities\nthat prompt-level safeguards cannot address; (3) DR agents not only bypass\nrefusals but also produce more coherent, professional, and dangerous content,\ncompared with standalone LLMs. These results demonstrate a fundamental\nmisalignment in DR agents and call for better alignment techniques tailored to\nDR agents.

We introduce\nDr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that\nequips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip,\nexecute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision:\nusing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer\nconfigurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our\ndesign, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing,\nand bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long\nsequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to\n+3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to\nout-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA,\nAGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and\noutperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive\nworkflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the\neffectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and\nnoise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring\nstreams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally\nunsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in\nLLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but\nthe challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In\nthis paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention\nbudget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design\nprinciple for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as\ncompression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most\nrelevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building\nbenchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating\ntoken-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by\nretrieving external documents. As an emerging form of RAG, parametric\nretrieval-augmented generation (PRAG) encodes documents as model parameters\n(i.e., LoRA modules) and injects these representations into the model during\ninference, enabling interaction between the LLM and documents at parametric\nlevel. Compared with directly placing documents in the input context, PRAG is\nmore efficient and has the potential to offer deeper model-document\ninteraction. Despite its growing attention, the mechanism underlying parametric\ninjection remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic\nstudy of PRAG to clarify the role of parametric injection, showing that\nparameterized documents capture only partial semantic information of documents,\nand relying on them alone yields inferior performance compared to interaction\nat text level. However, these parametric representations encode high-level\ndocument information that can enhance the model's understanding of documents\nwithin the input context. When combined parameterized documents with textual\ndocuments, the model can leverage relevant information more effectively and\nbecome more robust to noisy inputs, achieving better performance than either\nsource alone. We recommend jointly using parameterized and textual documents\nand advocate for increasing the information content of parametric\nrepresentations to advance PRAG.",

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various\nfields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question\nanswering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency\nmodeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which\nweakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the\n''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information\nin the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global\ndependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and\nsimple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose\nDual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The\nContextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by\nassessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and\nposition-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)\nmodule enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information\nexchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in\nlong-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play\nsolution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.\nExtensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across\nmainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score\nimprovement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and\nQwen2.5-14B-Instruct.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,\nproducing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also\nheightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no\nprior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In\nthis paper, we introduce \\dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector\nrobustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired\nwith their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large\nperformance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some\nstate-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation\nto the \\textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative\nin general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized\ntext. Based on this finding, we propose \\method, a simple and reliable way to\npredict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \\method\nidentifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs\nprobe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector\ndependence. Our experiments show that \\method can accurately predict both the\ndirection and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\\% correlation\nwith the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further\nresearch on personalized text detection.",

Existing approaches to\nimproving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such\nas prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These\nworks treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does\nthe LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,\nparticularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a\nprobing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe\nthree findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest\nas latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often\namplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,\nwe propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a\nframework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level\nknowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,\nand (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to\naccurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three\nbenchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and\ncontextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under\ndiverse conflict conditions.

        "abstract": "Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance\ntranslation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced\npretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic\nrules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more\nrobust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning\nobjectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial\nfor natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation\nframework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs\nto predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of\nreal-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across\nthree language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2\nas the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM\nachieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent\nimprovements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average\nLagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct\ncomparison.

We address a more realistic and challenging\nsetting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only\n\"one life\" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We\nintroduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through\nconditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming\nframework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,\nactivating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph\nthat routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding\nscaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,\nhierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with\nsparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding\nconstraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state\nranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible\nones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that\nclosely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,\nour reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,\nobject-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on\nthat state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from\nminimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23\nscenarios tested.

        "abstract": "When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,\nthey often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models\n(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations\nthrough natural language requests (e.g., \"I want to see respectful posts with a\ndifferent perspective than mine\"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows\nfor natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time\nwith computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to\nsimulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,\nand we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We\nthen integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting\nof signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,\nwe require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing\nfor real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens\ndataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a\ndiversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that\nCTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'\nsense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional\ncontrols.",

We construct training data by augmenting model\nsamples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or\n'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the\nmodel and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering\n(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT\nsubstantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and\nintroducing minimal semantic distribution shift.

Existing methods primarily focus on either fine-tuning\nLLMs to generate recommendations or integrating LLM-based embeddings into\ndownstream models. In this work, we follow the latter direction and propose\n\\textbf{TextGCN}, which applies parameter-free graph convolution layers\ndirectly over LLM-based item-title embeddings, instead of learning ID-based\nembeddings as in traditional methods. By combining language semantics with\ngraph message passing, this architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\nperformance, significantly outperforming prior approaches. Furthermore, we\nintroduce \\textbf{TextGCN-MLP}, which extends TextGCN with a trainable\nmultilayer perceptron trained using a contrastive loss, achieving\nstate-of-the-art in-domain performance on recommendation benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not\ntrivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics\nremain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to\nassess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,\nRecombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)\ngenerates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue\nand continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined\nsequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and\nenables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we\nfind that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect\nenhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference\nwhen relevant cues (e.g., \"Hey, wait a minute\") are present. Although\ninstruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects\na hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.",

        "abstract": "There is growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to\nautomate and support complex decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear\nhow algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic\nunderstanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge\nassignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges.\nSpecifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation\nChallenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \\$500,000\nto student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where\nhigh-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based\njudge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE),\nand deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against\nhuman expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on\n$309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we\nfound no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the\ntwo approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated\n$3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an\nexcellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a\nfull week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during\ndeployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level\nmatching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency,\nunderscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human\ndecision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings.",

To address these\nissues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of\nmultimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To\nfacilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),\nwhich injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process\nwithin the latent space.

We further\nintroduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to\nperform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and\nScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance\nincrease of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase\nof over 5 times compared to existing approaches.

However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'\ntendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,\nwhich can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To\nsystematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we\nprobe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward\nestimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure\nplanning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows\nthat while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify\nmeaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in\nfull-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling\nenvironment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we\npropose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM\nsimulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from\nexternal tutorials.

Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently\nrely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When\npuzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a\nstriking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?\nTo what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general\nway of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these\nthings systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25\nwell-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve\nreasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate\neleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom\nrecall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious\nrationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this\nissue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to\ndetect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error\ncategories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these\ncategories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models\nsignificantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom\nrecall and over-elaboration.

        "title": "Content Anonymization for Privacy in Long-form Audio",
        "abstract": "Voice anonymization techniques have been found to successfully obscure a\nspeaker's acoustic identity in short, isolated utterances in benchmarks such as\nthe VoicePrivacy Challenge. In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in\nisolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone\ncalls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are\navailable, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple\nutterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's\nvocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their\nvoice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content\nanonymization approaches. Our approach performs a contextual rewriting of the\ntranscripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while\npreserving meaning. We present results in a long-form telephone conversation\nsetting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on\nvoice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based\nanonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility.\nOverall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against\ncontent-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure\nanonymity in long-form audio.",

        "title": "Resource-sensitive but language-blind: Community size and not grammatical complexity better predicts the accuracy of Large Language Models in a novel Wug Test",
        "abstract": "The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing\ndebate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model\nperformance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.\nUsing a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across\nfour partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and\ncompared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy\napproximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic\ncomplexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with\nprevious research, the results show that the models are able to generalize\nmorphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,\naccuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability\nthan with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In\nparticular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital\nrepresentation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than\nless-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that\nmodel behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather\nthan by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance\nthat resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.",
