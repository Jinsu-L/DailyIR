        "abstract": "We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin\ndesigned for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and\nunified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection\nand refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.\nThis work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating\nvisual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs\nconsistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap\nfrom human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two\nautomated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train\nOmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for\nuniversal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).\nThrough training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification\nand demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We\npropose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that\nleverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within\nunified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through\niterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal\nverifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.\nEmpirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),\nand GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,\nsuch as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual\nverification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation\nand scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and\ncontrollable next-generation reasoning systems.",

        "abstract": "As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tackles complex tasks, increasingly\nexpanded contexts offer richer information, but at the cost of higher latency\nand increased cognitive load on the model. To mitigate this bottleneck,\nespecially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a\nuniversal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given\nquery from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration\ninto in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts\n(fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression\nof extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios.\nFurthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by\nallowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four\nopen-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates\nmore concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large,\nand proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by\nBRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x,\nwhile requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.",

Recent\nwork has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in\n(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding\nobjectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that\ndrive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a\ncontrolled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding\narises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal\nanalysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer\ncomputations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where\nattention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of\nlinguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across\narchitectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional\nLSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol\ngrounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for\npredicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.",

We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:\nthe performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs\nrelative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.\nRecent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech\nsynthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic\ndata, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not\nreproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient\nalternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we\nanalyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities\nduring adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text.\nBased on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with\nLearning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines\ncross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment\nwhile mitigating forgetting.

Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families\n(7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to\n41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%.

However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial\nlimitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,\nwhich constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,\nespecially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that\ntrainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token\nselection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading\nwithout altering the underlying attention computation.

        "abstract": "Knowledge is inherently time-sensitive and continuously evolves over time.\nAlthough current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enrich LLMs with\nexternal knowledge, they largely ignore this temporal nature. This raises two\nchallenges for RAG. First, current RAG methods lack effective time-aware\nrepresentations. Same facts of different time are difficult to distinguish with\nvector embeddings or conventional knowledge graphs. Second, most RAG\nevaluations assume a static corpus, leaving a blind spot regarding update costs\nand retrieval stability as knowledge evolves. To make RAG time-aware, we\npropose Temporal GraphRAG (TG-RAG), which models external corpora as a bi-level\ntemporal graph consisting of a temporal knowledge graph with timestamped\nrelations and a hierarchical time graph. Multi-granularity temporal summaries\nare generated for each time node to capture both key events and broader trends\nat that time. The design supports incremental updates by extracting new\ntemporal facts from the incoming corpus and merging them into the existing\ngraph. The temporal graph explicitly represents identical facts at different\ntimes as distinct edges to avoid ambiguity, and the time hierarchy graph allows\nonly generating reports for new leaf time nodes and their ancestors, ensuring\neffective and efficient updates. During inference, TG-RAG dynamically retrieves\na subgraph within the temporal and semantic scope of the query, enabling\nprecise evidence gathering. Moreover, we introduce ECT-QA, a time-sensitive\nquestion-answering dataset featuring both specific and abstract queries, along\nwith a comprehensive evaluation protocol designed to assess incremental update\ncapabilities of RAG systems.

        "abstract": "The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and\nReinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire\ngeneration, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This\nwork positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal\nlogic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a\nmechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads\nbetween locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that\nlocally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating\nphrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad\ndownstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:\n1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward\nattention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which\nquantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives\nfrom subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring\npreplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range\ncontextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately\nfollowed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent\nreasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies\nthat dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan\ntokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent\nperformance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with\nthe model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization\ninto an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step\ntoward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.",

To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce \\bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark\nspecifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer\ndomain. \\bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind,\nsupporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an\nautomated curation pipeline.",

        "title": "LiteraryQA: Towards Effective Evaluation of Long-document Narrative QA",
        "abstract": "Question Answering (QA) on narrative text poses a unique challenge to current\nsystems, requiring a deep understanding of long, complex documents. However,\nthe reliability of NarrativeQA, the most widely used benchmark in this domain,\nis hindered by noisy documents and flawed QA pairs. In this work, we introduce\nLiteraryQA, a high-quality subset of NarrativeQA focused on literary works.\nUsing a human- and LLM-validated pipeline, we identify and correct low-quality\nQA samples while removing extraneous text from source documents. We then carry\nout a meta-evaluation of automatic metrics to clarify how systems should be\nevaluated on LiteraryQA. This analysis reveals that all n-gram-based metrics\nhave a low system-level correlation to human judgment, while LLM-as-a-Judge\nevaluations, even with small open-weight models, can strongly agree with the\nranking identified by humans. Finally, we benchmark a set of long-context LLMs\non LiteraryQA. We release our code and data at\nhttps://github.com/SapienzaNLP/LiteraryQA.",
