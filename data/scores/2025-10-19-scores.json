        "title": "MTmixAtt: Integrating Mixture-of-Experts with Multi-Mix Attention for Large-Scale Recommendation",
        "abstract": "Industrial recommender systems critically depend on high-quality ranking\nmodels. However, traditional pipelines still rely on manual feature engineering\nand scenario-specific architectures, which hinder cross-scenario transfer and\nlarge-scale deployment. To address these challenges, we propose\n\\textbf{MTmixAtt}, a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with\nMulti-Mix Attention, designed for large-scale recommendation tasks. MTmixAtt\nintegrates two key components. The \\textbf{AutoToken} module automatically\nclusters heterogeneous features into semantically coherent tokens, removing the\nneed for human-defined feature groups. The \\textbf{MTmixAttBlock} module\nenables efficient token interaction via a learnable mixing matrix, shared dense\nexperts, and scenario-aware sparse experts, capturing both global patterns and\nscenario-specific behaviors within a single framework. Extensive experiments on\nthe industrial TRec dataset from Meituan demonstrate that MTmixAtt consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines including Transformer-based models,\nWuKong, HiFormer, MLP-Mixer, and RankMixer. At comparable parameter scales,\nMTmixAtt achieves superior CTR and CTCVR metrics; scaling to MTmixAtt-1B yields\nfurther monotonic gains. Large-scale online A/B tests validate the real-world\nimpact: in the \\textit{Homepage} scenario, MTmixAtt increases Payment PV by\n\\textbf{+3.62\\%} and Actual Payment GTV by \\textbf{+2.54\\%}. Overall, MTmixAtt\nprovides a unified and scalable solution for modeling arbitrary heterogeneous\nfeatures across scenarios, significantly improving both user experience and\ncommercial outcomes.",

Built on over 2.3\nmillion full-text papers from arXiv.org, SQuAI employs four collaborative\nagents to decompose complex questions into sub-questions, retrieve targeted\nevidence via hybrid sparse-dense retrieval, and adaptively filter documents to\nimprove contextual relevance. To ensure faithfulness and traceability, SQuAI\nintegrates in-line citations for each generated claim and provides supporting\nsentences from the source documents. Our system improves faithfulness, answer\nrelevance, and contextual relevance by up to +0.088 (12%) over a strong RAG\nbaseline.

However, their performance remains constrained by\nlimited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as\ncontext to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically\noperate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information\ndensity and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose\n\\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into\nstructured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement\nlearning, \\textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that\ndynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of\nmulti-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our\napproach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific\nstructures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and\nreliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural\nverification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both\ncorrect and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive\nbenchmarks show that \\textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive\nperformance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much\nlarger models.

        "title": "Mixture of Experts Approaches in Dense Retrieval Tasks",
        "abstract": "Dense Retrieval Models (DRMs) are a prominent development in Information\nRetrieval (IR). A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is\nthat they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains\nthey were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR\nincorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer\nlayer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of\nadditional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which\nintroduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To\nassess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical\nevaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation\nsetups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot\ngeneralizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different\nunderlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective\ntest sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform\nzero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform\nfurther experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters\n(i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this\nvariation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE\nis particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as\nTinyBERT and BERT-Small, consistently exceeding standard model fine-tuning\nacross benchmarks. For DRMs with more parameters, such as BERT-Base and\nContriever, our model requires a larger number of training samples to achieve\nimproved retrieval performance.

        "abstract": "Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,\npopular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade\nunder distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize\nexpected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,\nprompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,\nDRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian\noptimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set\naround the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes\nworst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian\nsearch. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution\nshift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the\ninstruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality\nrewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench\ninformative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to\napproximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.\nMoreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.\nMeanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating\nno loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent\nacross divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero\nconnects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a\nplug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment\nunder real-world uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "Fault cause identification in automated manufacturing lines is challenging\ndue to the system's complexity, frequent reconfigurations, and the limited\nreusability of existing Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) knowledge.\nAlthough FMEA worksheets contain valuable expert insights, their reuse across\nheterogeneous lines is hindered by natural language variability, inconsistent\nterminology, and process differences. To address these limitations, this study\nproposes a process-aware framework that enhances FMEA reusability by combining\nmanufacturing-domain conceptualization with graph neural network (GNN)\nreasoning. First, FMEA worksheets from multiple manufacturing lines are\ntransformed into a unified knowledge graph through ontology-guided large\nlanguage model (LLM) extraction, capturing domain concepts such as actions,\nstates, components, and parameters. Second, a Relational Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (RGCN) with the process-aware scoring function learns embeddings that\nrespect both semantic relationships and sequential process flows. Finally, link\nprediction is employed to infer and rank candidate fault causes consistent with\nthe target line's process flow.\n  A case study on automotive pressure sensor assembly lines demonstrates that\nthe proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) baseline (F1@20 = 0.267) and an RGCN approach (0.400),\nachieving the best performance (0.523) in fault cause identification. Ablation\nstudies confirm the contributions of both LLM-driven domain conceptualization\nand process-aware learning. These results indicate that the proposed framework\nsignificantly improves the transferability of FMEA knowledge across\nheterogeneous lines, thereby supporting operators in diagnosing failures more\nreliably and paving the way for future domain-adaptive LLM applications in\nsmart manufacturing.",

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where\nLLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer\nassessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to\nevaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates\ngame-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a\nprincipled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human\npreferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between\ntheoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into\nthe promises and limitations of mutual evaluation.

Large Language Models (LLMs) act\nas a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it\naccessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a\ncross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a\ntarget language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing\nresearch has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and\ntarget languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an\nalternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target\nlanguage is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the\ncross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive\nexperimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We\nthen reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions\nthat control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a\nsimple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved\ntarget accuracy by 20-25% across different models.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce AutoGraph-R1, the\nfirst framework to directly optimize KG construction for task performance using\nReinforcement Learning (RL).

However, their\nunstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts\nmake automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements\nin natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as\nequally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across\nclinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively\ngeneralize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present\nTACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to\naddress these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts\nduring training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL\ndynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual\nsamples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler\ncases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling\nmore complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including\nEnglish and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements\nacross diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission\nprediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the\nperformance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify\napproaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,\nscalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.",

Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines\nfeeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face\nkey limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles\nwith context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models\nin external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text,\ntables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG.\nThis approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities,\nunlocking comprehensive document intelligence.

We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and\ngranularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic\nframeworks.

        "abstract": "Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A\nmajor obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is\ncatastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired\ncapabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is\nchallenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we\ninvestigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without\ncatastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging\nmemory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by\ndesign. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new\npiece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce\ninterference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We\nevaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and\nparameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We\nfind that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting\nsubstantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after\nfull finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields\nonly an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results\nsuggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual\nlearning in large language models.",

        "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored for integration\nwith collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommendation systems, which are\ncrucial for personalizing user experiences. However, a key challenge is that\nLLMs struggle to interpret the latent, non-semantic embeddings produced by CF\napproaches, limiting recommendation effectiveness and further applications. To\naddress this, we propose FACE, a general interpretable framework that maps CF\nembeddings into pre-trained LLM tokens. Specifically, we introduce a\ndisentangled projection module to decompose CF embeddings into concept-specific\nvectors, followed by a quantized autoencoder to convert continuous embeddings\ninto LLM tokens (descriptors). Then, we design a contrastive alignment\nobjective to ensure that the tokens align with corresponding textual signals.\nHence, the model-agnostic FACE framework achieves semantic alignment without\nfine-tuning LLMs and enhances recommendation performance by leveraging their\npre-trained capabilities. Empirical results on three real-world recommendation\ndatasets demonstrate performance improvements in benchmark models, with\ninterpretability studies confirming the interpretability of the descriptors.\nCode is available in https://github.com/YixinRoll/FACE.",

The autonomous generation of these protocols\nthrough natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the\nreproduction process.

To\naddress this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of\nover 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing\nboth comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol\ngeneration, we propose the \"Sketch-and-Fill\" paradigm, which separates\nanalysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and\nverifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism\nevaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model\noptimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we\ndevelop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that\nprogresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately\nto robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth\nconsistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving\nsignificant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic\naccuracy.

        "abstract": "Document parsing from scanned images into structured formats remains a\nsignificant challenge due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text\nparagraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Existing supervised fine-tuning\nmethods often struggle to generalize across diverse document types, leading to\npoor performance, particularly on out-of-distribution data. This issue is\nfurther exacerbated by the limited availability of high-quality training data\nfor layout-aware parsing tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce\nLayoutRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes layout\nunderstanding through composite rewards integrating normalized edit distance,\nparagraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. To support this\ntraining, we construct the Infinity-Doc-400K dataset, which we use to train\nInfinity-Parser, a vision-language model demonstrating robust generalization\nacross various domains. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including\nOmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of\ndocument types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially\noutperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose\nvision-language models. We will release our code, dataset, and model to\nfacilitate reproducible research in document parsing.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise\nin Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the\nsemantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph\n(KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient\nexploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable\nreasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning\ncapabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set\nquestions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then\nretrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning\npaths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient\nFAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning\nprocess in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated\nsub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by\nproviding high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning\naccuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during\nrelation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising\npaths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the\nPlan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two\nreal-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP\nsignificantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.",

We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an\ninterpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining\nunsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring\nseed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of\nMeta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the\n2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse\nstructures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics\nwith moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting\nand immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion\nand election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are\nequally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs,\nabortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and\ncrime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing\nof these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression\nrhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and\nliberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong\ncorrelations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also\nemerges.

We study one simple setting in which\ntruth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements\nco-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model\nto learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We\ncorroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models.\nFinally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks\nfirst memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a\nlonger horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn\nlowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a\nmechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear\ntruth representations can emerge in language models.",

To mitigate the training instability observed in the mixture model, we\nintroduce a decoupled training approach with theoretical insights.

        "title": "From Characters to Tokens: Dynamic Grouping with Hierarchical BPE",
        "abstract": "Subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used in\nlarge language models due to their balance of vocabulary compactness and\nrepresentational power. However, they suffer from inefficiencies in\nrepresenting rare words and require large embedding matrices. Character-level\nmodels address these issues but introduce performance bottlenecks, particularly\nin Transformer-based architectures. Recent hierarchical models attempt to merge\nthe benefits of both paradigms by grouping characters into patches, but\nexisting patching strategies either rely on whitespace-limiting applicability\nto certain languages, or require auxiliary models that introduce new\ndependencies. In this paper, we propose a dynamic character grouping method\nthat leverages the structure of existing BPE tokenization without requiring\nadditional models. By appending explicit end-of-patch markers to BPE tokens and\nintroducing a second-level BPE compression stage to control patch granularity,\nour method offers efficient, flexible, and language-agnostic representations.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds the\nperformance of dynamic entropy- and whitespace-based patching strategies, while\nmaintaining a compact vocabulary.",

        "abstract": "With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases\nrapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the\nfirst to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)\ntask. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural\nhomogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which\nchallenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in\neffectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval\nmechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM\nintroduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates\ndynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from\nspecific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning\nof drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between\nwords and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction\nmodule, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic\nterm to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and\nimprove the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of\ncomplex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive\nfeature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and\nmatching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on\ntwo self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other\nexisting methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and\ndataset will be made publicly available.",

        "abstract": "Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising\napproach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their\ncomplementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token\nprobability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be\neffective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers,\nits application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper,\nwe show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a\ncareful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of\nensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key\nfactors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models\nand consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we\npropose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively\nensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability,\nwe introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities\nspread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single\nrepresentative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500\nand BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy\nand efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of\ntokens.",

        "abstract": "The E-commerce advertising platforms typically sell commercial traffic\nthrough either second-price auction (SPA) or first-price auction (FPA). SPA was\nhistorically prevalent due to its dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC)\nfor bidders with quasi-linear utilities, especially when budgets are not a\nbinding constraint, while FPA has gained more prominence for offering higher\nrevenue potential to publishers and avoiding the possibility for discriminatory\ntreatment in personalized reserve prices. Meanwhile, on the demand side,\nadvertisers are increasingly adopting platform-wide marketing solutions akin to\nQuanZhanTui, shifting from spending budgets solely on commercial traffic to\nbidding on the entire traffic for the purpose of maximizing overall sales. For\nautomated bidding systems, such a trend poses a critical challenge: determining\noptimal strategies across heterogeneous auction channels to fulfill diverse\nadvertiser objectives, such as maximizing return (MaxReturn) or meeting target\nreturn on ad spend (TargetROAS). To overcome this challenge, this work makes\ntwo key contributions. First, we derive an efficient solution for optimal\nbidding under FPA channels, which takes into account the presence of organic\ntraffic - traffic can be won for free. Second, we introduce a marginal cost\nalignment (MCA) strategy that provably secures bidding efficiency across\nheterogeneous auction mechanisms. To validate performance of our developed\nframework, we conduct comprehensive offline experiments on public datasets and\nlarge-scale online A/B testing, which demonstrate consistent improvements over\nexisting methods.",

While large language models now\napproximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level\nconsensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief\ntrajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,\nwe introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for\naverage-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a\nspecific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given\npartial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a\nsynthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for\necologically valid, \"out-loud\" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,\nreproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not\njust what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with\nstate-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent\nas the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the\nindividuality of human thought.

        "title": "CORE: Reducing UI Exposure in Mobile Agents via Collaboration Between Cloud and Local LLMs",
        "abstract": "Mobile agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and execute tasks\non smartphone user interfaces (UIs). While cloud-based LLMs achieve high task\naccuracy, they require uploading the full UI state at every step, exposing\nunnecessary and often irrelevant information. In contrast, local LLMs avoid UI\nuploads but suffer from limited capacity, resulting in lower task success\nrates. We propose $\\textbf{CORE}$, a $\\textbf{CO}$llaborative framework that\ncombines the strengths of cloud and local LLMs to $\\textbf{R}$educe UI\n$\\textbf{E}$xposure, while maintaining task accuracy for mobile agents. CORE\ncomprises three key components: (1) $\\textbf{Layout-aware block partitioning}$,\nwhich groups semantically related UI elements based on the XML screen\nhierarchy; (2) $\\textbf{Co-planning}$, where local and cloud LLMs\ncollaboratively identify the current sub-task; and (3)\n$\\textbf{Co-decision-making}$, where the local LLM ranks relevant UI blocks,\nand the cloud LLM selects specific UI elements within the top-ranked block.\nCORE further introduces a multi-round accumulation mechanism to mitigate local\nmisjudgment or limited context. Experiments across diverse mobile apps and\ntasks show that CORE reduces UI exposure by up to 55.6% while maintaining task\nsuccess rates slightly below cloud-only agents, effectively mitigating\nunnecessary privacy exposure to the cloud.
