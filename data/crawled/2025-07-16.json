        "abstract": "Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly\nchallenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and\nmemory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable.\nNevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ\nfixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air\ntransmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address\nthis limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework\nfor communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank\nconfiguration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted\nprojections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential\ndecision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates\ncoarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic\ncomplexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models\n(DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The\ntwo modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the\nClassifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards.\nExperiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM\nconsistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing\ntransmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven,\ndiffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning\nover the air.",

Previous work has attempted to\ncompare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that\nhave different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We\nintroduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and\ndecoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on\nup to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and\ndecoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their\nrespective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as\ndecoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at\nclassification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.\nHowever, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice\nversa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse\nobjective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa\nfor generative tasks).

However, traditional approaches typically treat\nthis task as a static classification problem, relying on handcrafted features\nor isolated deep learning models. These methods often lack the robustness\nneeded to handle incomplete, heterogeneous, or noisy intelligence, and they\nprovide limited transparency in decision-making-factors that reduce their\neffectiveness in real-world threat environments. To address these limitations,\nwe propose LRCTI, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework designed for\nmulti-step CTI credibility verification. The framework first employs a text\nsummarization module to distill complex intelligence reports into concise and\nactionable threat claims. It then uses an adaptive multi-step evidence\nretrieval mechanism that iteratively identifies and refines supporting\ninformation from a CTI-specific corpus, guided by LLM feedback. Finally, a\nprompt-based Natural Language Inference (NLI) module is applied to evaluate the\ncredibility of each claim while generating interpretable justifications for the\nclassification outcome. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets,\nCTI-200 and PolitiFact show that LRCTI improves F1-Macro and F1-Micro scores by\nover 5%, reaching 90.9% and 93.6%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines.

To address this, we\nintroduce Dr.Copilot , a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system that\nsupports Romanian-speaking doctors by evaluating and enhancing the presentation\nquality of their written responses. Rather than assessing medical correctness,\nDr.Copilot provides feedback along 17 interpretable axes. The system comprises\nof three LLM agents with prompts automatically optimized via DSPy. Designed\nwith low-resource Romanian data and deployed using open-weight models, it\ndelivers real-time specific feedback to doctors within a telemedicine platform.\nEmpirical evaluations and live deployment with 41 doctors show measurable\nimprovements in user reviews and response quality, marking one of the first\nreal-world deployments of LLMs in Romanian medical settings.",

In recent years, numerous machine learning-based methods have been\ndeveloped to detect hateful comments on online platforms automatically.\nHowever, research on Chinese hate speech detection lags behind, and\ninterpretability studies face two major challenges: first, the scarcity of\nspan-level fine-grained annotated datasets limits models' deep semantic\nunderstanding of hate speech; second, insufficient research on identifying and\ninterpreting coded hate speech restricts model explainability in complex\nreal-world scenarios. To address these, we make the following contributions:\n(1) We introduce the Span-level Target-Aware Toxicity Extraction dataset (STATE\nToxiCN), the first span-level Chinese hate speech dataset, and evaluate the\nhate semantic understanding of existing models using it.

To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA\nsignificantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously\noverlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures.

        "abstract": "The growing prevalence of cross-border financial activities in global markets\nhas underscored the necessity of accurately identifying and classifying foreign\nentities. This practice is essential within the Spanish financial system for\nensuring robust risk management, regulatory adherence, and the prevention of\nfinancial misconduct. This process involves a labor-intensive entity-matching\ntask, where entities need to be validated against available reference sources.\nChallenges arise from linguistic variations, special characters, outdated\nnames, and changes in legal forms, complicating traditional matching algorithms\nlike Jaccard, cosine, and Levenshtein distances. These methods struggle with\ncontextual nuances and semantic relationships, leading to mismatches. To\naddress these limitations, we explore Large Language Models (LLMs) as a\nflexible alternative. LLMs leverage extensive training to interpret context,\nhandle abbreviations, and adapt to legal transitions. We evaluate traditional\nmethods, Hugging Face-based LLMs, and interface-based LLMs (e.g., Microsoft\nCopilot, Alibaba's Qwen 2.5) using a dataset of 65 Portuguese company cases.\nResults show traditional methods achieve accuracies over 92% but suffer high\nfalse positive rates (20-40%). Interface-based LLMs outperform, achieving\naccuracies above 93%, F1 scores exceeding 96%, and lower false positives\n(40-80%).",

Such techniques have\nbeen shown to improve the effectiveness of traditional lexical retrieval\nmethods by dealing with the vocabulary mismatch problem. Recent work has found\nthat generating queries with a greedy decoding strategy can produce sub-optimal\nqueries, including hallucinations, and proposed to filter out queries before\nexpansion. This `generate-then-filter' approach is costly, as it requires\ngenerating multiple queries and applying a relevance model to all of them and\ndoes not teach the LLM which of the generated queries is more effective for\nexpansion. To overcome such limitations, we propose Aligned Query Expansion\n(AQE), a novel approach to enhance query expansion for passage retrieval in\nopen-domain question answering. AQE leverages recent techniques in LLM\nalignment to fine-tune models for generating query expansions that directly\noptimize the effectiveness of the retrieval task, eliminating the need for\nadditional filtering steps. This alignment ensures that queries are more\nrelevant, reducing computational costs while improving retrieval effectiveness.\nEmpirical evaluations show that AQE outperforms baseline models for query\nexpansion in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrating\nsignificant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing\nlarge language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and\ncomputational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of\nLlama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from\n51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.\nFurthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as\nGPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging\nW4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision\nbaselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource\nlanguages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as\nhomophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To\naddress this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel\nmeaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)\nframework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja\n(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja\ncandidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual\ndisambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation\nto prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge\nsignificantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\\% relative\nimprovement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment\nbetween Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive\ncross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, these gains persist even when Hanja\naugmentation is omitted at inference time, ensuring practical efficiency with\nno additional run-time cost.",

        "title": "LLM-Driven Dual-Level Multi-Interest Modeling for Recommendation",
        "abstract": "Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests\nbased on their behaviors or auxiliary signals. However, existing methods often\nrely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same\ninterest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with\nreal-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) show significant\npotential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and\npowerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the\ngranularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to\noverly fine or coarse interest grouping. Second, individual user analysis\nprovides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we\npropose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more\neffective recommendation. At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to\nflexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters,\nindicating their diverse and distinct interests. To alleviate the agnostic\ngeneration of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users'\ncollaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions,\nallowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's\nbehaviors using an alignment module. To alleviate the limited insights derived\nfrom individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose\naggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more\ncomprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. We formulate a max covering\nproblem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users'\nbehaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven\nmulti-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.\nExperiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction\nquality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on\nexpert annotations.

The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC\nis a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes\nis imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive\nsmall language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the\nenhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we\naddress the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using\nunstructured product and services data.

Our\nexperiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied\nto the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains\ncomparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthe superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat\nclassifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and\nachieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only\narchitectures for structured sequence generation tasks.

Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts.

Interestingly, increased inconsistency\ncorrelates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate\nbiases.

        "title": "Can Multimodal Foundation Models Understand Schematic Diagrams? An Empirical Study on Information-Seeking QA over Scientific Papers",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to\nevaluate the ability of models to interpret schematic diagrams within\nscientific literature. MISS-QA comprises 1,500 expert-annotated examples over\n465 scientific papers. In this benchmark, models are tasked with interpreting\nschematic diagrams that illustrate research overviews and answering\ncorresponding information-seeking questions based on the broader context of the\npaper. We assess the performance of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models,\nincluding o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL. We reveal a significant\nperformance gap between these models and human experts on MISS-QA. Our analysis\nof model performance on unanswerable questions and our detailed error analysis\nfurther highlight the strengths and limitations of current models, offering key\ninsights to enhance models in comprehending multimodal scientific literature.",

        "title": "Language Models for Adult Service Website Text Analysis",
        "abstract": "Sex trafficking refers to the use of force, fraud, or coercion to compel an\nindividual to perform in commercial sex acts against their will. Adult service\nwebsites (ASWs) have and continue to be linked to sex trafficking, offering a\nplatform for traffickers to advertise their victims. Thus, organizations\ninvolved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when\nattempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge\nin transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous\nresearch using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking\nads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of\nemojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement\nscrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for\nthis application area, including simple information retrieval methods,\npre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that\ncharacteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to\nbe trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for\ninference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned\nvariants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,\nRoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We\ndemonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks\nrelated to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph\nrepresentation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the\nlearned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context\nwe study. The models we develop represent a significant advancement in ASW text\nanalysis, which can be leveraged in a variety of downstream applications and\nresearch.",

        "abstract": "Understanding relationships between documents in large-scale corpora is\nessential for knowledge discovery and information organization. However,\nexisting approaches rely heavily on manual annotation or predefined\nrelationship taxonomies. We propose EDR-MQ (Extracting Document Relations by\nMarginalizing over User Queries), a novel framework that discovers document\nrelationships through query marginalization. EDR-MQ is based on the insight\nthat strongly related documents often co-occur in results across diverse user\nqueries, enabling us to estimate joint probabilities between document pairs by\nmarginalizing over a collection of queries. To enable this query\nmarginalization approach, we develop Multiply Conditioned Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (MC-RAG), which employs conditional retrieval where subsequent\ndocument retrievals depend on previously retrieved content. By observing\nco-occurrence patterns across diverse queries, EDR-MQ estimates joint\nprobabilities between document pairs without requiring labeled training data or\npredefined taxonomies. Experimental results show that our query marginalization\napproach successfully identifies meaningful document relationships, revealing\ntopical clusters, evidence chains, and cross-domain connections that are not\napparent through traditional similarity-based methods. Our query-driven\nframework offers a practical approach to document organization that adapts to\ndifferent user perspectives and information needs.",
