        "title": "OneSearch: A Preliminary Exploration of the Unified End-to-End Generative Framework for E-commerce Search",
        "abstract": "Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading\narchitectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall,\npre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational\nefficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented\ncomputation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which\nultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose\n\\textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative\nframework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key\ninnovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE)\nmodule, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes\nwhile maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view\nuser behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user\nIDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences\nto model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward\nSystem (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive\nreward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive\noffline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's\nsuperior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online\nA/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure\nposition, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\\% item CTR,\n+2.40\\% buyer, and +3.22\\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces\noperational expenditure by 75.40\\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from\n3.26\\% to 27.32\\%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple\nsearch scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of\nmillions of PVs daily.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text\nembedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the\nembedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].\nHowever, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the\nsemantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,\nespecially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training\nstage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token\nembedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,\nnamely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based\nDocument-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and\nreconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM\nperformance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new\nstate-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.",

We address these questions with a\ncomprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct\nmeasurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the\npolitical science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct\npointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,\ntoken-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields\nactionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate\npointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with\nbunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with\npairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking\npointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning\nsmaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the\nperformance of prompted LLMs.",

A growing body of work illustrates the promise of\nintegrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's\ngenerality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by\nincorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized\nformulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only\nto domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the\ncontextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim\nto automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual\nintervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of\nscientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,\nadding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We\nextensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and\nPySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three\nphysical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic\nwave).

        "abstract": "We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary\nfoundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured\ndata. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large\nstructured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint\ndistribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide\nrange of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single\nmodel. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an\nepisodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query\nsubsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,\ntraining-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large\nstructured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature\ndimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,\nmissingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified\ninterface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including\ngradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation\nmodels, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The\nsuperiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,\nregression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial\nmargins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per\ntask. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.",

        "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of\nmeaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture\non a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to\nimplement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the\nmechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay\nbetween the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.\nThe following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)\nincreased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over\nall tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which\nincreased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened\nalong the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance\nconsiderably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,\nhigher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though\nthe learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.\nThese pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy\nalong the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction\nconfidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input\nmeaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match\ntokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image\nclassification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in\nfine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results\nwere based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and\nfine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.",

However, the internal processes through which models turn data\ninto representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly\nunderstood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs\nwith knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.\nTo facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing\nknowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a\nknowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based\non Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that\noutperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained\nmodels with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with\ncomparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.\nTogether, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing\nconnections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,\nand the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the\nutility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding\nthat fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends.

        "abstract": "Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience\ndisproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders\ncompared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a\nconsequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study\npresents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures\nfor detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple\ntransformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against\ntraditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further\nassess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability\non underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest\npublicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising\n12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure\nrobustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure\nconsistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and\nthat supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and\nfew-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social\nconnectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the\nmodels' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity\nconcealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that\ngraph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital\nhealth interventions and public health policy.",

        "abstract": "Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired\nand deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its\nsignificance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access\nto educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social\nexclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend\non Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although\ncertain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for\nindividuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent\nrequirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially\nfor Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions\nhave primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a\nconsiderable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,\nspecifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of\nisolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of\ncontinuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research\nrepresents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we\nintroduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,\nfocusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable\nsophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.\nAdditionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained\nResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with\nBidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\\% accuracy at\nsigner dependent mode and 77.71\\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This\ndevelopment leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL\ncommunity but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign\nlanguage.",

Evaluating whether\nLLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is\nchallenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of\nsimilarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable\nevaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied\ntask, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing\nexpert similarity ratings via a \"pick-the-odd-one-out\" triplet judgment task,\nand (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones\n(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human\nbenchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets\n(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based\nmetrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful\nto experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with\nexpert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and\nvector-based metrics.

All\nimplementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future\nwork.",
