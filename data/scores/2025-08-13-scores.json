        "title": "Adaptive Personalized Conversational Information Retrieval",
        "abstract": "Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to\nsatisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by\nconsidering user profiles. However, not all search queries require\npersonalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating\npersonalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies\nimplicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context\nusing large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements\nfor each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy\nmight lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive\npersonalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization\nlevel for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query\nreformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a\npersonalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights\ndynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required\npersonalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational\ninformation retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.\nThe results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

        "title": "Generating Query-Relevant Document Summaries via Reinforcement Learning",
        "abstract": "E-commerce search engines often rely solely on product titles as input for\nranking models with latency constraints. However, this approach can result in\nsuboptimal relevance predictions, as product titles often lack sufficient\ndetail to capture query intent. While product descriptions provide richer\ninformation, their verbosity and length make them unsuitable for real-time\nranking, particularly for computationally expensive architectures like\ncross-encoder ranking models. To address this challenge, we propose ReLSum, a\nnovel reinforcement learning framework designed to generate concise,\nquery-relevant summaries of product descriptions optimized for search\nrelevance. ReLSum leverages relevance scores as rewards to align the objectives\nof summarization and ranking, effectively overcoming limitations of prior\nmethods, such as misaligned learning targets. The framework employs a trainable\nlarge language model (LLM) to produce summaries, which are then used as input\nfor a cross-encoder ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in offline metrics, including recall and NDCG, as well as online\nuser engagement metrics.

        "abstract": "Evaluating personalized recommendations remains a central challenge,\nespecially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline\nmetrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods such as A/B testing are\ncostly and operationally constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to\nassess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable\nmanner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language\nuser profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles\nsummarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact,\ninterpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the\nLLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically\nrich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment\nbetween a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input\ncomplexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver\nfine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode\nmatch. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge\nmatched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a\nvariant using raw listening histories.

        "abstract": "SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form\nwhile preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite\nrules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)\nfixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with\ncomplex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be\nfully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using\nlarge language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex\nstrategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this\npotential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent\nrewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To\naddress these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting\nframework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It\nintegrates two core components: a context construction module and a\nreinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution\nplans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide\ninference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting\nexecutability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,\nequivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable\nmulti-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes\nexecutability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.\nExtensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\\% reduction in\nquery execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL\nbenchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\\% more successful rewrites,\nexpanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.",

It achieves joint training of the\nRQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining\nbehavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve\ndynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the\nprobability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.\nThis facilitates an efficient \"soft-search\" strategy during online inference,\nrevolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from \"passive matching\" to \"proactive\nexploration\" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B\ntests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have\nachieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view\nduration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in\nPV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are\nconducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and\nNormalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent\nimprovement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and\npractical value of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural\nhuman-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,\nindustrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,\ndeveloping accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains\na significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic\ncomplexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable\ntraining pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised\nfine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we\npretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both\nModern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the\nsubsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture\nof filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.\nOur approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the\nmulti-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the\neffectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data\nscarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich\nlanguages.",

        "abstract": "The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose\nsignificant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive\ndecoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token\nprediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed\nthat some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic\nparallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel\ndecoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In\nthis paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which\naddresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data\nand efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a\nnon-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable\nstructures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient\nadaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which\nenables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while\nmaintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive\nevaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical\nReasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both\neffectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up\nto 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within\n1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant\nacceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a\ngroundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way\nfor its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered\ncustomer service bots and answer retrieval engines.",

        "abstract": "LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.\nRAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like\nthat in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses\nsignificant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential\ninsecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking\ntransparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected\nRAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,\nthus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous\nentities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric\nabstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),\nthe first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically\ncapturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful\nsemantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),\nthe second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into\nstructured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned\nwith the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.\nTo guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies\nstrictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three\ndatasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and\nprivacy-robustness.",

        "abstract": "Route recommendation (RR) is a core task of route planning in the Amap app,\nwith the goal of recommending the optimal route among candidate routes to\nusers. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local\nquality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for\nenhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.\nTo achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison\nNetwork (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and\nitem-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in\ntraditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features\nwhich describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture\nthe local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block\n(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a\nComprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can\nupdate the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive\ncomparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of\ncandidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since\nroutes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model\nmust be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an\ninterpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability. Both offline\nand online experiments demonstrate that CCN significantly improves RR\nperformance and exhibits strong interpretability. CCN has been fully deployed\nin the Amap app for over a year, providing stable and optimal benefits for\nroute recommendations.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks\nsuch as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference\nover extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose\nmemory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at\neach decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load\nimportant tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to\naddress the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In\nthis paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that\nretrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries\nfrom subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,\nRetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant\ncontext, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the\nfixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior\napproximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that\nRetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression\nmethods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\\times$ and accuracy by\nup to 21.9\\%.",

We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style\nexperts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them\nthrough TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,\nTiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp\nand merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing\nstrict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.\nWe also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are\nexplicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained\nmeasurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks\nplus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best\nsingle-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%.

This integration has led to the\ndevelopment of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in\nreal-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate\ntasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require\nunderstanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents\nthat can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to\nuser-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four\ninterconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,\n(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)\nSpatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and\n(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an\nimplementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target\napplication and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our\nframework across diverse domains.

We extended IndeGx with a\nfully ontology-oriented modeling and processing approach to do so. Using SPARQL\nrules and an OWL RL ontology of the indexing domain, IndeGx can now build and\nreason over an index of the contents and characteristics of an open collection\nof public knowledge graphs. Our extension of the framework relies on a\ndeclarative representation of procedural knowledge and collaborative\nenvironments (e.g., GitHub) to provide an agile, customizable, and expressive\nKR approach for building and maintaining such an index of knowledge graphs in\nthe wild. In doing so, we help anyone answer the question of what knowledge is\nout there in the world wild Semantic Web in general, and we also help our\ncommunity monitor which KR research results are used in practice.

These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using\na pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically\nfuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile.\nExperimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves\nsubstantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness\nof our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically\nrich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based\nrecommendation.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative\ndenoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate\npredictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical\nphenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the\nmiddle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative\nTSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the\nCountdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we\nachieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and\n25.3% on Countdown, respectively.

In this work, we\npropose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous\ntoken budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to\nfirst discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more\nconcise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances\nthree signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and\nformatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,\nSVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training\nconsistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,\nachieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency.

DeCAL\nuses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to\nproduce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the\nencoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on\nmaximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that\nDeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with\nusually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among\nquestion-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL\noffers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be\nutilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more\nbroadly applicable.",

        "abstract": "Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between\nsurface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing\nsequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga\nnarrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models\nexcel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal\ncausality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story\ncomprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines\nfine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and\nretrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these\nlimitations.\n  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual\nelements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)\ncomprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct\ninference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity\nanalysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint\nrepresentations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters\nwith 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form\nnarrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative\nstorytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our\nfindings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,\nstruggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and\ncausal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the\nfoundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,\nwhile providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential\nunderstanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in\nMultimodal Models.",

To bridge this gap,\nwe propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method\nthat probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying\ncultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract\nthe cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure\nof the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize\nWestern-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how\ncultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs\nencode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural\nknowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to\ncultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources.

However,\nmost existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token\nat a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation\nspeed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this\nchallenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel\ntext generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the\ntoken-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.\nDespite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on\nwhat specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they\nimprove inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic\nsurvey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches\ninto AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of\nthe core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess\ntheir theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and\nexamine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative\nacceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent\nadvancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for\nfuture research in parallel text generation.

        "abstract": "LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use\nof in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into\nhigh-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into\nlow-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and\nsupervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by\nthe size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common\ntechnique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most\nfrequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are\nautomatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the\nexistence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily\navailable for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \\textsc{TopXGen}, an\nLLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in\nmultiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse\nparallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs\nstruggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and\ntheir multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding\ntarget-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source\nlanguage.

We do not propose a novel\nend-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a\nsystematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the\ndynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences.\nThis approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for\nrecommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into\ncomprehensive user embeddings. The evaluation across Movies&TV and Video Games\ndomains suggests that while LLM-generated profiles offer semantic depth and\ntemporal structure, their effectiveness for context-aware recommendations is\nnotably contingent on the richness of user interaction histories. Significant\ngains are observed in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV), whereas improvements are\nless pronounced in sparse environments (e.g., Video Games).

In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily\nlarge (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node\nselection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is\nnegligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently\nlimited by the game (e.g., $d\\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we\npropose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each\nselected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves\namortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional\nqueue-based OPEN list.
