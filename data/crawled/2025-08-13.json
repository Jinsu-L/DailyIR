        "abstract": "Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative\ndenoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate\npredictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical\nphenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the\nmiddle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative\nTSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the\nCountdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we\nachieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and\n25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped\npotential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective\ntools to harness them.",

As tasks grow more challenging, the\nlogic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly\nintricate.

LogicIFGen is a\nscalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code\nfunctions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,\nnesting, recursion, and function calls.

Our experiments demonstrate\nthat current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the\ninstructions in LogicIFEval.

While\nnumerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation\nabilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they\noften rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to\nscale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,\nmost existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual\nbenchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To\naddress these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for\ngenerating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual\nannotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases\nby generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a\nmultilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order\nproblem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we\nintroduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising\n3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is\nspecifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical\nmultilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary\nLLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The\nresults show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,\ndiversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce\nAutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their\nfew-shot code generation capabilities.

        "abstract": "Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in\nindustrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens\ngenerated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,\nessentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due\nto limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the\nlatency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt\nlength. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long\noccupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to\nseparate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud\nhelps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.\nSpecifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with\nits own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.\nThen, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for\nsmoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the\nprogress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the\nresource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the\nprompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to\nfurther speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,\nand confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an\nalgorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT\ndecreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud\nthroughput increases by up to 15x.",

        "abstract": "SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form\nwhile preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite\nrules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)\nfixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with\ncomplex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be\nfully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using\nlarge language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex\nstrategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this\npotential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent\nrewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To\naddress these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting\nframework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It\nintegrates two core components: a context construction module and a\nreinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution\nplans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide\ninference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting\nexecutability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,\nequivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable\nmulti-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes\nexecutability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.\nExtensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\\% reduction in\nquery execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL\nbenchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\\% more successful rewrites,\nexpanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks\nsuch as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference\nover extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose\nmemory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at\neach decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load\nimportant tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to\naddress the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In\nthis paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that\nretrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries\nfrom subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,\nRetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant\ncontext, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the\nfixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior\napproximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that\nRetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression\nmethods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\\times$ and accuracy by\nup to 21.9\\%.",

By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed\nthat some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic\nparallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel\ndecoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In\nthis paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which\naddresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data\nand efficient parallel decoding mechanism.

To empower efficient\nadaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which\nenables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while\nmaintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive\nevaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical\nReasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both\neffectiveness and efficiency.

        "abstract": "The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse\ncultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the\novergeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations\nimpacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic\nevaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'\ninternal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method\nthat probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying\ncultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract\nthe cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure\nof the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize\nWestern-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how\ncultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs\nencode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural\nknowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to\ncultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work\nprovides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and\nenhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments\nare publicly available.",

At inference time,\nTiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp\nand merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing\nstrict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.\nWe also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are\nexplicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained\nmeasurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks\nplus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best\nsingle-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%.

        "abstract": "LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.\nRAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like\nthat in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses\nsignificant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential\ninsecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking\ntransparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected\nRAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,\nthus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous\nentities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric\nabstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),\nthe first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically\ncapturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful\nsemantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),\nthe second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into\nstructured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned\nwith the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.\nTo guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies\nstrictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three\ndatasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and\nprivacy-robustness.",

        "abstract": "Route recommendation (RR) is a core task of route planning in the Amap app,\nwith the goal of recommending the optimal route among candidate routes to\nusers. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local\nquality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for\nenhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.\nTo achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison\nNetwork (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and\nitem-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in\ntraditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features\nwhich describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture\nthe local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block\n(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a\nComprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can\nupdate the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive\ncomparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of\ncandidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since\nroutes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model\nmust be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an\ninterpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability. Both offline\nand online experiments demonstrate that CCN significantly improves RR\nperformance and exhibits strong interpretability. CCN has been fully deployed\nin the Amap app for over a year, providing stable and optimal benefits for\nroute recommendations.",

Recently, \\textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented\ngenerated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements\nin this domain.

Despite this significant\nprogress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In\nthis work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark\n(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning\nfive scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in\nterms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,\nwe develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy\nContexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),\nand Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely\nused rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into\ntheir relative strengths and limitations.

However, existing methods suffer from\nthe superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow\nand unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely\nand consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,\nwe propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait\nelicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are\nformed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates\nand optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises\nself-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The\noptimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic\nobjective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target\ntrait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,\nleading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across\nthree human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated\nself-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait\nacross diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,\nconsistently outperforming existing strong baselines.",

To further enhance\nmobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve\nmobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus\nsolely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while\nneglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes\nit difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to\nevaluate the \\textbf{I}ntention \\textbf{A}lignment \\textbf{R}ate between\nmobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \\textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset\ncontaining human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions.

IFRAgent analyzes\nexplicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level\nvector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit\nintention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages\na SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query\nrewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,\nenhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.\nExperimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an\naverage of 6.79\\% (32.06\\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment\nrate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\\% (26.34\\%\nrelative improvement).

Recently,\ntest-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving\nsolution quality.

        "abstract": "Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between\nsurface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing\nsequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga\nnarrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models\nexcel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal\ncausality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story\ncomprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines\nfine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and\nretrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these\nlimitations.\n  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual\nelements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)\ncomprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct\ninference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity\nanalysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint\nrepresentations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters\nwith 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form\nnarrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative\nstorytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our\nfindings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,\nstruggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and\ncausal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the\nfoundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,\nwhile providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential\nunderstanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in\nMultimodal Models.",

        "abstract": "We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states\nof large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20\nopen-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity\ncombining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token\ncertainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.\nRandom-weight models conserve this \"energy\" more tightly than pre-trained ones,\nwhile training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater\nvariability. Using this \"log-Lagrangian\" view, we derive a control method\ncalled Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way\nneeded to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy\nin two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic\nquality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this\nmechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly\ndetection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more\npredictable and aligned with human intent.",

Existing approaches often rely on\nsimplistic user profiling methods, such as averaging or concatenating item\nembeddings, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of user preference\ndynamics, particularly the interactions between long-term and short-term\npreferences. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling\n(LLM-TUP), a novel method for user profiling that explicitly models short-term\nand long-term preferences by leveraging interaction timestamps and generating\nnatural language representations of user histories using a large language model\n(LLM). These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using\na pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically\nfuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile.\nExperimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves\nsubstantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness\nof our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically\nrich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based\nrecommendation.",

        "abstract": "Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether\nmorphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,\nparticularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we\nselect a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi\n(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from\ntokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task\nevaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed\nacross tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment\nand tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in\nTelugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600\nderivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.\n  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates\npositively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such\nas Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.\nHowever, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.\nUnigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance\nthan morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others\nacross most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological\nsegmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In\ncontrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\\'enyi entropy\nshowed no correlation with downstream performance.",

While\nselecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity\nwith traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the\ntree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\\log N)$, which roughly\ncorresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily\nlarge (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node\nselection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is\nnegligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently\nlimited by the game (e.g., $d\\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we\npropose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each\nselected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves\namortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional\nqueue-based OPEN list.
