- **Experiment**: The system was deployed over three years, yielding a cumulative +27 % lift in online GoodRate metrics; evaluation was conducted using the RAIR benchmark and human preference alignment.
- **Takeaway**: LORE offers a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle, serving as a practical solution for e‑commerce search and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.

#### Abstract
> Achievement. We introduce LORE, a systematic framework for Large Generative Model-based relevance in e-commerce search. Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.

### 2. AskNearby: An LLM-Based Application for Neighborhood Information Retrieval and Personalized Cognitive-Map Recommendations

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 12
- **Authors**: Luyao Niu, Zhicheng Deng, Boyang Li, Nuoxian Huang, Ruiqi Liu, Wenjia Zhang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02502v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 07:47:31
- **Topic Keywords**: information retrieval, ranking, rag, retrieval, recommend, rank
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of location-based systems and personalized recommendations. The use of Learning to Rank and cognitive-map modeling aligns with your interests in query understanding and user behavior modeling. However, the focus on a specific application domain (neighborhood information retrieval) prevents it from being a central match to your broader research themes.

#### Abstract
> The "15-minute city" envisions neighborhoods where residents can meet daily needs via a short walk or bike ride. Realizing this vision requires not only physical proximity but also efficient and reliable access to information about nearby places, services, and events. Existing location-based systems, however, focus mainly on city-level tasks and neglect the spatial, temporal, and cognitive factors that shape localized decision-making. We conceptualize this gap as the Local Life Information Accessibility (LLIA) problem and introduce AskNearby, an AI-driven community application that unifies retrieval and recommendation within the 15-minute life circle. AskNearby integrates (i) a three-layer Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that synergizes graph-based, semantic-vector, and geographic retrieval with (ii) a cognitive-map model that encodes each user's neighborhood familiarity and preferences. Experiments on real-world community datasets demonstrate that AskNearby significantly outperforms LLM-based and map-based baselines in retrieval accuracy and recommendation quality, achieving robust performance in spatiotemporal grounding and cognitive-aware ranking. Real-world deployments further validate its effectiveness. By addressing the LLIA challenge, AskNearby empowers residents to more effectively discover local resources, plan daily activities, and engage in community life.

### 3. ADORE: Autonomous Domain-Oriented Relevance Engine for E-commerce

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 8
- **Authors**: Zheng Fang, Donghao Xie, Ming Pang, Chunyuan Yuan, Xue Jiang, Changping Peng, Zhangang Lin, Zheng Luo
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02555v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 09:25:13
- **Comment**: Accepted by SIGIR 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: relevance, user behavior, commerce, e-commerce, search
- **Reason**: This paper aligns well with your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the e-commerce domain, with a focus on relevance modeling and deep semantic understanding. The proposed ADORE framework addresses challenges in term-matching methods and neural models, leveraging innovations in rule-aware relevance discrimination, error-type-aware data synthesis, and knowledge distillation. While not exclusively focused on query understanding or ranking models, the paper's emphasis on cognitive alignment and robustness makes it relevant to your broader interests in IR and NLP.

#### Abstract
> Relevance modeling in e-commerce search remains challenged by semantic gaps in term-matching methods (e.g., BM25) and neural models' reliance on the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples. We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

### 4. Spatially-Grounded Document Retrieval via Patch-to-Region Relevance Propagation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 10
- **Authors**: Agathoklis Georgiou
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02660v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 11:29:54
- **Comment**: 13 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables. Open-source implementation available at https://github.com/athrael-soju/Snappy
- **Topic Keywords**: query, relevance, rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper explores a novel approach to document retrieval that combines vision-language models with OCR-based systems. While it touches on aspects of information retrieval, its primary focus is on spatially-grounded document retrieval, which is somewhat related to your interests in query understanding and ranking models. However, the paper's emphasis on vision-language models and spatial relevance propagation is not a central match for your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

### 5. TriLex: A Framework for Multilingual Sentiment Analysis in Low-Resource South African Languages

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Mike Nkongolo, Hilton Vorster, Josh Warren, Trevor Naick, Deandre Vanmali, Masana Mashapha, Luke Brand, Alyssa Fernandes, Janco Calitz, Sibusiso Makhoba
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02799v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 14:16:31
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval augmented generation, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data mining, but it focuses on sentiment analysis and multilingual NLP, which is not a central match to your primary focus on information retrieval and query understanding. The use of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a relevant technique, but the application is specific to sentiment analysis and low-resource languages.

#### Abstract
> Low-resource African languages remain underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting both lexical coverage and the performance of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness. The findings establish TriLex as a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages.

### 6. Q-BERT4Rec: Quantized Semantic-ID Representation Learning for Multimodal Recommendation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Haofeng Huang, Ling Gai
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02474v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 07:06:44
- **Comment**: Submitted to KDD2026
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, recommend, personalization, commerce, e-commerce
- **Reason**: The paper Q-BERT4Rec is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, particularly in the context of multimodal recommendation and sequential understanding. However, it focuses more on recommender systems and does not directly address your core areas of interest in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Sequential recommendation plays a critical role in modern online platforms such as e-commerce, advertising, and content streaming, where accurately predicting users' next interactions is essential for personalization. Recent Transformer-based methods like BERT4Rec have shown strong modeling capability, yet they still rely on discrete item IDs that lack semantic meaning and ignore rich multimodal information (e.g., text and image). This leads to weak generalization and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Bert4Rec, a multimodal sequential recommendation framework that unifies semantic representation and quantized modeling. Specifically, Q-Bert4Rec consists of three stages: (1) cross-modal semantic injection, which enriches randomly initialized ID embeddings through a dynamic transformer that fuses textual, visual, and structural features; (2) semantic quantization, which discretizes fused representations into meaningful tokens via residual vector quantization; and (3) multi-mask pretraining and fine-tuning, which leverage diverse masking strategies -- span, tail, and multi-region -- to improve sequential understanding. We validate our model on public Amazon benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Bert4Rec significantly outperforms many strong existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of semantic tokenization for multimodal sequential recommendation. Our source code will be publicly available on GitHub after publishing.

### 7. Think in Parallel, Answer as One: Logit Averaging for Open-Ended Reasoning

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Haonan Wang, Chao Du, Kenji Kawaguchi, Tianyu Pang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02874v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 15:35:31
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, search
- **Reason**: This paper explores a novel decoding strategy called ThinkMerge for open-ended reasoning tasks such as code generation and web-based deep research. While it touches on aspects of parallel processing, which is related to query understanding and ranking models, its primary focus is on improving the coherence of outputs rather than addressing core IR or NLP challenges. The paper's relevance to user interests is somewhat limited, but it may be of interest to those working on large language models or deep semantic understanding.

#### Abstract
> Majority voting has proven effective for close-ended question answering by aggregating parallel reasoning traces. However, it is not directly applicable to open-ended reasoning, such as code generation and web-based deep research, where a "majority" over complete solutions is ill-defined. We introduce ThinkMerge, a training-free, plug-and-play decoding strategy that runs K parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points to produce a single coherent output. ThinkMerge integrates seamlessly with vLLM/SGLang and remains compatible with standard decoding techniques such as Top-p/Top-k. Empirically, it matches or surpasses majority voting on AIME and GPQA, while delivering consistent gains on open-ended coding tasks: on LiveCodeBench (hard), pass@1 improves by +8.28% for DeepCoder-14B-Preview and +7.58% for Qwen3-8B. Beyond code, we further show that ThinkMerge improves web-based deep-research agents (e.g., WebSailor-7B/32B) across GAIA, BrowseComp-en/zh, and XbenchDeepSearch. These results demonstrate that parallel test-time scaling can benefit open-ended reasoning without relying on voting over complete outputs.

### 8. Input Order Shapes LLM Semantic Alignment in Multi-Document Summarization

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Jing Ma
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02665v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 11:36:13
- **Comment**: 9 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables
- **Topic Keywords**: pairwise
- **Reason**: This paper explores the impact of input order on semantic alignment in multi-document summarization using large language models (LLMs). While it touches on aspects of query understanding and ranking models, its primary focus is on the behavior of LLMs in summarization tasks, which is somewhat related to your interests in Information Retrieval and NLP. However, the specific context and application domain (multi-document summarization) is not a central match for your research themes.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are now used in settings such as Google's AI Overviews, where it summarizes multiple long documents. However, it remains unclear whether they weight all inputs equally. Focusing on abortion-related news, we construct 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets, permute each triplet into six input orders, and prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a neutral overview. We evaluate each summary against its source articles using ROUGE-L (lexical overlap), BERTScore (semantic similarity), and SummaC (factual consistency). One-way ANOVA reveals a significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, indicating that summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article. Pairwise comparisons further show that Position 1 differs significantly from Positions 2 and 3, while the latter two do not differ from each other, confirming a selective preference for the first document. The findings present risks for applications that rely on LLM-generated overviews and for agentic AI systems, where the steps involving LLMs can disproportionately influence downstream actions.

### 9. Lightweight Latent Reasoning for Narrative Tasks

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Alexander Gurung, Nikolay Malkin, Mirella Lapata
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02240v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-01 22:07:32
- **Topic Keywords**: query
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, particularly in the area of query understanding and ranking models. However, the focus on narrative tasks and latent reasoning in large language models is not directly aligned with your primary interests in e-commerce and real-time relevance optimization. The paper's use of reinforcement learning and token sampling is also not a central match to your research themes.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) tackle complex tasks by generating long chains of thought or "reasoning traces" that act as latent variables in the generation of an output given a query. A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.

### 10. Martingale Score: An Unsupervised Metric for Bayesian Rationality in LLM Reasoning

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Zhonghao He, Tianyi Qiu, Hirokazu Shirado, Maarten Sap
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02914v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 16:34:05
- **Comment**: NeurIPS 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to the user's interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and large language models, but it focuses on the evaluation of Bayesian rationality in LLM reasoning, which is not directly aligned with the user's primary focus on information retrieval and query understanding. The paper's emphasis on unsupervised metrics and belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning is somewhat relevant to the user's interests in deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization, but it is not a central match.

#### Abstract
> Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

### 11. SurveyEval: Towards Comprehensive Evaluation of LLM-Generated Academic Surveys

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Jiahao Zhao, Shuaixing Zhang, Nan Xu, Lei Wang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02763v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 13:42:09
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of query understanding and ranking models. However, its focus on evaluating LLM-generated academic surveys is more aligned with NLP and data mining, rather than your primary focus on IR and deep semantic understanding. While it touches on the idea of information retrieval, it's not a central match for your research themes.

#### Abstract
> LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

### 12. What Signals Really Matter for Misinformation Tasks? Evaluating Fake-News Detection and Virality Prediction under Real-World Constraints

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Francesco Paolo Savatteri, Chahan Vidal-Gorène, Florian Cafiero
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02552v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 09:24:16
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, particularly in the context of deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization. However, it focuses on misinformation detection and virality prediction, which is a specific application rather than a core theme. The use of textual embeddings and sequence models is relevant, but the paper's primary contribution is in the evaluation of these methods for misinformation tasks.

#### Abstract
> We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.

### 13. See, Think, Learn: A Self-Taught Multimodal Reasoner

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Sourabh Sharma, Sonam Gupta, Sadbhawna
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02456v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 06:30:10
- **Comment**: Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision 2026
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on multimodal reasoning in Vision-Language Models, which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the paper's emphasis on visual perception and structured rationales is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes. The connection to deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization is also not explicitly mentioned.

#### Abstract
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

### 14. Detecting AI Hallucinations in Finance: An Information-Theoretic Method Cuts Hallucination Rate by 92%

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Mainak Singha

- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 05:25:48
- **Comment**: 17 pages, 7 figures. Information-theoretic, hallucination detector for financial application. Feedback from researchers and practitioners is welcome
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of query understanding and ranking models. However, the focus on detecting AI hallucinations in finance, while using information-theoretic methods, is not directly related to your primary areas of interest in e-commerce and deep semantic understanding. The connection to NLP is also present, but it's not a central match.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) produce fluent but unsupported answers - hallucinations - limiting safe deployment in high-stakes domains. We propose ECLIPSE, a framework that treats hallucination as a mismatch between a model's semantic entropy and the capacity of available evidence. We combine entropy estimation via multi-sample clustering with a novel perplexity decomposition that measures how models use retrieved evidence. We prove that under mild conditions, the resulting entropy-capacity objective is strictly convex with a unique stable optimum. We evaluate on a controlled financial question answering dataset with GPT-3.5-turbo (n=200 balanced samples with synthetic hallucinations), where ECLIPSE achieves ROC AUC of 0.89 and average precision of 0.90, substantially outperforming a semantic entropy-only baseline (AUC 0.50). A controlled ablation with Claude-3-Haiku, which lacks token-level log probabilities, shows AUC dropping to 0.59 with coefficient magnitudes decreasing by 95% - demonstrating that ECLIPSE is a logprob-native mechanism whose effectiveness depends on calibrated token-level uncertainties. The perplexity decomposition features exhibit the largest learned coefficients, confirming that evidence utilization is central to hallucination detection. We position this work as a controlled mechanism study; broader validation across domains and naturally occurring hallucinations remains future work.

### 15. CAIRNS: Balancing Readability and Scientific Accuracy in Climate Adaptation Question Answering

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Liangji Kong, Aditya Joshi, Sarvnaz Karimi
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02251v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-01 22:44:43
- **Comment**: Short Paper; Under Review at The WebConf 2026 (single-blind submission)
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the area of question answering and query understanding. However, the focus on climate adaptation and scientific accuracy is not directly aligned with your primary interests in e-commerce and deep semantic understanding. The use of LLM-based evaluation is a tangential connection to your work in NLP.

#### Abstract
> Climate adaptation strategies are proposed in response to climate change. They are practised in agriculture to sustain food production. These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs). We present Climate Adaptation question-answering with Improved Readability and Noted Sources (CAIRNS), a framework that enables experts -- farmer advisors -- to obtain credible preliminary answers from complex evidence sources from the web. It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Using a previously reported dataset of expert-curated question-answers, we show that CAIRNS outperforms the baselines on most of the metrics. Our thorough ablation study confirms the results on all metrics. To validate our LLM-based evaluation, we also report an analysis of correlations against human judgment.

### 16. GraphMatch: Fusing Language and Graph Representations in a Dynamic Two-Sided Work Marketplace

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 1
- **Authors**: Mikołaj Sacha, Hammad Jafri, Mattie Terzolo, Ayan Sinha, Andrew Rabinovich
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02849v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-02 15:02:10
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend
- **Reason**: The paper explores a recommendation framework that combines language and graph representations, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the focus is on recommendation systems rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest. The use of pre-trained language models and graph neural networks is relevant to NLP and data mining, but the application to a specific domain (two-sided marketplace) limits its relevance to broader IR and search topics.

#### Abstract
> Recommending matches in a text-rich, dynamic two-sided marketplace presents unique challenges due to evolving content and interaction graphs. We introduce GraphMatch, a new large-scale recommendation framework that fuses pre-trained language models with graph neural networks to overcome these challenges. Unlike prior approaches centered on standalone models, GraphMatch is a comprehensive recipe built on powerful text encoders and GNNs working in tandem. It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. These results demonstrate that unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution to text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs in practice.

- **Topic Keywords**: search
- **Reason**: The paper discusses prompt optimization for large language models, which is related to query understanding in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on NLP and LLMs is not directly aligned with the user's primary research interests in IR and search technologies.

#### Abstract
> Prompt optimization has become crucial for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) across a broad range of tasks. Although many research papers show its effectiveness, practical adoption is hindered as existing implementations are often tied to unmaintained and isolated research codebases. To address this, we introduce promptolution, a unified and modular open-source framework that provides all components required for prompt optimization within a single extensible system for both practitioners and researchers. It integrates multiple contemporary discrete prompt optimizers while remaining agnostic to the underlying LLM implementation.

- **Reason**: This paper explores the emergent Bayesian behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on LLMs and their multimodal integration strategies is not directly aligned with the user's primary research interests in IR and Search technologies.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

- **Reason**: The paper discusses omni-modal guardrails for safety and value in human-AI interaction, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the focus on multimodal safety and deliberate reasoning ability is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The connection to NLP and data mining is also indirect, as the paper primarily deals with safeguarding and risk mitigation in AI systems.

#### Abstract
> Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

#### Abstract
> Spoken conversational agents are converging toward voice-native LLMs. This tutorial distills the path from cascaded ASR/NLU to end-to-end, retrieval-and vision-grounded systems. We frame adaptation of text LLMs to audio, cross-modal alignment, and joint speech-text training; review datasets, metrics, and robustness across accents and compare design choices (cascaded vs. E2E, post-ASR correction, streaming). We link industrial assistants to current open-domain and task-oriented agents, highlight reproducible baselines, and outline open problems in privacy, safety, and evaluation.

- **Topic Keywords**: query, rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on video reasoning and memory-augmented methods, which is not directly related to your core research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While it involves multimodal memory and retrieval, the context is video reasoning rather than text-based search or ranking models.

#### Abstract
> Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on multimodal safety vulnerabilities in large language models, proposing a new image-centric attack method. While it touches on the interaction between text and image, it doesn't directly relate to query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling in information retrieval, which are core areas of your research interests.

#### Abstract
> While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on video object segmentation using reinforcement learning, which is not directly related to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While it involves sequential decision-making, it's primarily a computer vision task and doesn't address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on Large Language Model alignment and proposes a new quality signal derived from model representations. While it involves ranking and optimization, the context is NLP and model alignment, which is somewhat related to your interests in Information Retrieval and NLP, but not directly aligned with your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on external supervision, which faces critical limitations: human annotations are scarce and subjective, reward models are vulnerable to reward hacking, and self-evaluation methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and biases. In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines. Our findings demonstrate that quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision.

While it involves some optimization techniques, the context and application are quite different from the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation.

While it involves Natural Language Generation and large language models, its focus on interactive story generation and fine-grained control does not align with your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> With the advancement of natural language generation (NLG) technologies, creative story generation systems have gained increasing attention. However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

#### Abstract
> The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain presents an urgent need to assess their clinical application capabilities. However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.

#### Abstract
> Prompt design plays a critical role in the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the impact of prompt specificity - how detailed or vague a prompt is - remains understudied. This paper introduces DETAIL, a framework for evaluating LLM performance across varying levels of prompt specificity. We generate multi-level prompts using GPT-4, quantify specificity via perplexity, and assess correctness using GPT-based semantic equivalence. Experiments on 30 novel reasoning tasks across GPT-4 and O3-mini reveal that specificity improves accuracy, especially for smaller models and procedural tasks. Our results highlight the need for adaptive prompting strategies and provide tools and data to support further research.

While it does involve language models, the context is language acquisition rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> This paper presents an initial study performed by the MODOMA system. The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.

#### Abstract
> Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models, but their practical utility is severely hampered by slow, iterative sampling. We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.

The paper focuses on security vulnerabilities in Large Language Model-based agents and computational resource exploitation, which is outside your primary research areas.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning, planning, and tool usage. The recently proposed Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a unifying framework for integrating external tools into agent systems, enabling a thriving open ecosystem of community-built functionalities. However, the openness and composability that make MCP appealing also introduce a critical yet overlooked security assumption -- implicit trust in third-party tool providers. In this work, we identify and formalize a new class of attacks that exploit this trust boundary without violating explicit permissions. We term this new attack vector implicit toxicity, where malicious behaviors occur entirely within the allowed privilege scope. We propose LeechHijack, a Latent Embedded Exploit for Computation Hijacking, in which an adversarial MCP tool covertly expropriates the agent's computational resources for unauthorized workloads. LeechHijack operates through a two-stage mechanism: an implantation stage that embeds a benign-looking backdoor in a tool, and an exploitation stage where the backdoor activates upon predefined triggers to establish a command-and-control channel. Through this channel, the attacker injects additional tasks that the agent executes as if they were part of its normal workflow, effectively parasitizing the user's compute budget. We implement LeechHijack across four major LLM families. Experiments show that LeechHijack achieves an average success rate of 77.25%, with a resource overhead of 18.62% compared to the baseline. This study highlights the urgent need for computational provenance and resource attestation mechanisms to safeguard the emerging MCP ecosystem.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit hallucinations, generating content that appears fluent and coherent but is factually incorrect. Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.
