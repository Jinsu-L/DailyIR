#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: DeepSieve: A Novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation Method for Multi-Hop Question Answering
- **Aim**: To develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method that addresses the limitations of existing RAG systems by incorporating information sieving via a Large Language Model (LLM) as a knowledge router
- **Rationale**: Existing RAG methods do not address source- or tool-aware routing in heterogeneous environments, and recent advancements in RAG systems combine large language models with structured and unstructured knowledge
- **Ground**: DeepSieve's modular design allows it to sieve and integrate knowledge progressively, making it particularly suited for multi-hop reasoning and heterogeneous information access
- **Experiment**: The authors evaluate DeepSieve on three multi-hop question answering (QA) benchmarks and compare its performance with several baselines, and conduct an ablation study to understand the contribution of each module within DeepSieve
- **Takeaway**: DeepSieve consistently outperforms baselines across all three benchmarks, achieving higher F1/EM scores while using significantly fewer tokens, and demonstrates the effectiveness of its modular design in mitigating reasoning and retrieval failures commonly encountered in open-domain multi-hop QA tasks

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with
knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access
up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in
external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over
both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow
reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that
incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve
decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes
each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information
through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,
transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system
design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources
demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability
over conventional RAG approaches. Our codes are available at

### 2. Exploration on Demand: From Algorithmic Control to User Empowerment

- **LLM Score**: 6
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Edoardo Bianchi
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21884v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 14:57:26
- **Topic Keywords**: relevance, rag, recommend, personalization
- **Reason**: The paper explores recommender systems, which is a related topic to information retrieval, but the focus is on user empowerment and exploration rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. While the paper uses sentence-transformer embeddings, the application is in clustering and exploration, not directly in query understanding or ranking.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Adaptive Clustering Framework for Recommender Systems with User-Controlled Exploration
- **Aim**: To propose a novel adaptive clustering framework that balances personalization and diversity in recommender systems
- **Rationale**: The limitations of existing recommender systems in balancing personalization and diversity, leading to over-specialization and limited content discovery
- **Ground**: The system leverages sentence-transformer embeddings, adaptive clustering, and user-controlled exploration to create a structured representation of the content space
- **Experiment**: Experimental results on the MovieLens dataset show that exploration reduces intra-list similarity and increases unexpectedness, with 72.7% of long-term users preferring exploratory recommendations
- **Takeaway**: The proposed system achieves improved diversity and user satisfaction, with potential applications in real-world deployment, and suggests several future research directions for further improvement

#### Abstract
> Recommender systems often struggle with over-specialization, which severely
limits users' exposure to diverse content and creates filter bubbles that
reduce serendipitous discovery. To address this fundamental limitation, this
paper introduces an adaptive clustering framework with user-controlled
exploration that effectively balances personalization and diversity in movie
recommendations. Our approach leverages sentence-transformer embeddings to
group items into semantically coherent clusters through an online algorithm
with dynamic thresholding, thereby creating a structured representation of the
content space. Building upon this clustering foundation, we propose a novel
exploration mechanism that empowers users to control recommendation diversity
by strategically sampling from less-engaged clusters, thus expanding their
content horizons while preserving relevance. Experiments on the MovieLens
dataset demonstrate the system's effectiveness, showing that exploration
significantly reduces intra-list similarity from 0.34 to 0.26 while
simultaneously increasing unexpectedness to 0.73. Furthermore, our Large
Language Model-based A/B testing methodology, conducted with 300 simulated
users, reveals that 72.7% of long-term users prefer exploratory recommendations
over purely exploitative ones, providing strong evidence for the system's
ability to promote meaningful content discovery without sacrificing user
satisfaction.

### 3. Benchmarking Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search Algorithms on Transformer-based Embedding Vectors

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Patrick Iff, Paul Bruegger, Marcin Chrapek, Maciej Besta, Torsten Hoefler
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21989v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 16:39:54
- **Topic Keywords**: query, retrieval, recommend, search
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS) algorithms, which is a specific problem in Information Retrieval. While it mentions transformer-based embedding vectors, it does not directly relate to query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest. The paper's scope is more focused on the FANNS problem and its benchmarking, rather than deep semantic understanding or real-time relevance optimization.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS) methods
- **Aim**: To provide a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of FANNS methods and introduce a novel dataset for evaluating FANNS methods
- **Rationale**: The lack of diverse and realistic datasets, particularly those derived from the latest transformer-based text embedding models, hinders the development of FANNS methods
- **Ground**: The authors introduce a novel dataset, arxiv-for-fanns, consisting of over 2.7 million research article abstracts from the arXiv repository, accompanied by 11 real-world attributes
- **Experiment**: The authors benchmark a diverse set of FANNS methods on the novel dataset, revealing that each method involves distinct trade-offs, and no single approach dominates across all conditions
- **Takeaway**: The choice of FANNS method depends on the specific use case and dataset characteristics, and there is no universally best FANNS method

#### Abstract
> Advances in embedding models for text, image, audio, and video drive progress
across multiple domains, including retrieval-augmented generation,
recommendation systems, vehicle/person reidentification, and face recognition.
Many applications in these domains require an efficient method to retrieve
items that are close to a given query in the embedding space while satisfying a
filter condition based on the item's attributes, a problem known as Filtered
Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS). In this work, we present a
comprehensive survey and taxonomy of FANNS methods and analyze how they are
benchmarked in the literature. By doing so, we identify a key challenge in the
current FANNS landscape: the lack of diverse and realistic datasets,
particularly ones derived from the latest transformer-based text embedding
models. To address this, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of embedding
vectors for the abstracts of over 2.7 million research articles from the arXiv
repository, accompanied by 11 real-world attributes such as authors and
categories. We benchmark a wide range of FANNS methods on our novel dataset and
find that each method has distinct strengths and limitations; no single
approach performs best across all scenarios. ACORN, for example, supports
various filter types and performs reliably across dataset scales but is often
outperformed by more specialized methods. SeRF shows excellent performance for
range filtering on ordered attributes but cannot handle categorical attributes.
Filtered-DiskANN and UNG excel on the medium-scale dataset but fail on the
large-scale dataset, highlighting the challenge posed by transformer-based
embeddings, which are often more than an order of magnitude larger than earlier
embeddings. We conclude that no universally best method exists.

### 4. Enhancing Graph-based Recommendations with Majority-Voting LLM-Rerank Augmentation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Minh-Anh Nguyen, Bao Nguyen, Ha Lan N. T., Tuan Anh Hoang, Duc-Trong Le, Dung D. Le
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21563v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 07:51:56
- **Topic Keywords**: rerank, rag, recommend, rank
- **Reason**: The paper proposes a novel data augmentation framework for recommendation systems, leveraging Large Language Models and item textual descriptions. While it touches on the topic of ranking models, the focus is on recommender systems rather than information retrieval. The paper's emphasis on graph-based recommendations and few-shot prompting also diverges from the user's primary interest in query understanding and ranking models.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Graph-based Recommendation Systems
- **Aim**: To propose a novel data augmentation framework, VoteGCL, for graph-based recommendation systems
- **Rationale**: To leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual descriptions to enrich interaction data and improve recommendation accuracy while mitigating popularity bias
- **Ground**: VoteGCL consists of three main components: a retrieval model, a few-shot prompting LLM for inference, and a graph contrastive learning (CL) paradigm
- **Experiment**: The authors evaluate VoteGCL using three metrics: NDCG@K, Recall@K, and APLT@K, and compare it against three categories of baseline models across multiple benchmarks
- **Takeaway**: VoteGCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based, multi-modal, and LLM-enhanced recommender models, improving recommendation accuracy and mitigating popularity bias

#### Abstract
> Recommendation systems often suffer from data sparsity caused by limited
user-item interactions, which degrade their performance and amplify popularity
bias in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual
descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple
times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we
generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by
theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively
leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we
integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate
distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show
that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming
strong baselines.

### 5. Who's important? -- SUnSET: Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for Timeline Generation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Tiviatis Sim, Kaiwen Yang, Shen Xin, Kenji Kawaguchi
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21903v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 15:14:39
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, rag, rank
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on news summarization and timeline generation, using large language models and graphical methods. While it mentions relevance and ranking, the context is different from the user's primary interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling in the context of information retrieval. The paper's emphasis on stakeholder importance and event connection is not directly related to the user's research themes.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Timeline Summarization (TLS) incorporating stakeholder information
- **Aim**: To develop a novel framework, SUnSET, for TLS that better understands the importance of events and their connections
- **Rationale**: To improve TLS by incorporating stakeholder information to enable a better representation of occurrences documented by a single news article
- **Ground**: SUnSET framework consists of three main sequences: SET Generation, Event Clustering, and Ranking, using Large Language Models and Coreference Resolution
- **Experiment**: Evaluating SUnSET using three metrics: Alignment-based ROUGE-1 F1-score, Alignment-based ROUGE-2 F1-score, and Date-F1, on two benchmark datasets, Crisis and T17
- **Takeaway**: SUnSET significantly improves Date-F1 scores and ROUGE-1 scores compared to state-of-the-art papers, and incorporating relevance improves the performance of SUnSET

#### Abstract
> As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online,
tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant
challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large
Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this
is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated
articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of
analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel
framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related
events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET:
Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of
Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs)
to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to
construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations.
Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new
State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within
news article.

### 6. Graph-R1: Towards Agentic GraphRAG Framework via End-to-end Reinforcement Learning

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Haoran Luo, Haihong E, Guanting Chen, Qika Lin, Yikai Guo, Fangzhi Xu, Zemin Kuang, Meina Song, Xiaobao Wu, Yifan Zhu, Luu Anh Tuan
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21892v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 15:01:26
- **Comment**: Preprint
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper proposes a framework for retrieval-augmented generation, which is related to information retrieval and natural language processing. However, the focus on entity-relation graphs and reinforcement learning is not directly aligned with the user's interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by
incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that
lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge
as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost,
fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt
design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG
framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight
knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn
agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an
end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that
Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in
reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

### 7. MAGIC: A Multi-Hop and Graph-Based Benchmark for Inter-Context Conflicts in Retrieval-Augmented Generation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Jungyeon Lee, Kangmin Lee, Taeuk Kim
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21544v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 07:19:49
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on retrieval-augmented generation, which is not directly related to the user's primary interest in information retrieval and search technologies. While it touches on knowledge conflict and conflict detection, the context is different from the user's focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The paper's emphasis on natural language processing and knowledge graphs is somewhat relevant, but not a central match for the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or
contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for
investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus
on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution
techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and
subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring
interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental
results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner
workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary
models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning
is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.
Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving
LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

### 8. Efficient Data Retrieval and Comparative Bias Analysis of Recommendation Algorithms for YouTube Shorts and Long-Form Videos

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Selimhan Dagtas, Mert Can Cakmak, Nitin Agarwal
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21467v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 03:13:41
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval, recommend, search
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on recommendation algorithms for YouTube Shorts and long-form videos, which is not directly related to the user's primary interest in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. While it touches on biases and echo chambers, which are relevant to user behavior modeling, the paper's scope is too narrow and specific to the e-commerce domain, and lacks a deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization aspect.

#### Abstract
> The growing popularity of short-form video content, such as YouTube Shorts,
has transformed user engagement on digital platforms, raising critical
questions about the role of recommendation algorithms in shaping user
experiences. These algorithms significantly influence content consumption, yet
concerns about biases, echo chambers, and content diversity persist. This study
develops an efficient data collection framework to analyze YouTube's
recommendation algorithms for both short-form and long-form videos, employing
parallel computing and advanced scraping techniques to overcome limitations of
YouTube's API. The analysis uncovers distinct behavioral patterns in
recommendation algorithms across the two formats, with short-form videos
showing a more immediate shift toward engaging yet less diverse content
compared to long-form videos. Furthermore, a novel investigation into biases in
politically sensitive topics, such as the South China Sea dispute, highlights
the role of these algorithms in shaping narratives and amplifying specific
viewpoints. By providing actionable insights for designing equitable and
transparent recommendation systems, this research underscores the importance of
responsible AI practices in the evolving digital media landscape.

### 9. Multilingual JobBERT for Cross-Lingual Job Title Matching

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Jens-Joris Decorte, Matthias De Lange, Jeroen Van Hautte
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21609v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 09:06:09
- **Comment**: Accepted to the TalentCLEF 2025 Workshop as part of CLEF 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, rank
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on cross-lingual job title matching using a contrastive learning-based model, which is not directly related to the user's primary research interests in Information Retrieval, query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. While the paper mentions ranking relevant skills for a given job title, it does not address the user's specific areas of interest in real-time relevance optimization and deep semantic understanding.

#### Abstract
> We introduce JobBERT-V3, a contrastive learning-based model for cross-lingual
job title matching. Building on the state-of-the-art monolingual JobBERT-V2,
our approach extends support to English, German, Spanish, and Chinese by
leveraging synthetic translations and a balanced multilingual dataset of over
21 million job titles. The model retains the efficiency-focused architecture of
its predecessor while enabling robust alignment across languages without
requiring task-specific supervision. Extensive evaluations on the TalentCLEF
2025 benchmark demonstrate that JobBERT-V3 outperforms strong multilingual
baselines and achieves consistent performance across both monolingual and
cross-lingual settings. While not the primary focus, we also show that the
model can be effectively used to rank relevant skills for a given job title,
demonstrating its broader applicability in multilingual labor market
intelligence. The model is publicly available:

### 10. Automatic Classification of User Requirements from Online Feedback -- A Replication Study

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Meet Bhatt, Nic Boilard, Muhammad Rehan Chaudhary, Cole Thompson, Jacob Idoko, Aakash Sorathiya, Gouri Ginde
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21532v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 06:52:27
- **Comment**: 10 pages, 3 figures, Replication package available at
  https://zenodo.org/records/15626782, Accepted at AIRE 2025 (12th
  International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Requirements
  Engineering)
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, search
- **Reason**: The paper is somewhat related to the user's interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data mining, but it does not directly align with their focus on Information Retrieval (IR), query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. The paper's topic of automatic classification of user requirements from online feedback is not a central match for the user's research themes.

#### Abstract
> Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the
requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and
ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,
it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The
rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,
machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the
forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),
"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset
Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning
models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the
original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to
strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the
setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing
results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the
replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating
replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across
different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In
contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed
that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good
generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed
performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.
Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication
readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced
readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and
provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and
support the replication of our study.

### 11. Conversations over Clicks: Impact of Chatbots on Information Search in Interdisciplinary Learning

- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 04:16:21
- **Comment**: 9 pages, 2 tables, 3 figures, 2025 ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education
  (FIE) Conference preprint
- **Topic Keywords**: click, search
- **Reason**: The paper explores the impact of chatbots on information search in interdisciplinary learning, which is related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the focus on e-learning environments and chatbots is not directly aligned with the user's interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The paper's relevance is somewhat limited to the user's background in e-commerce, but it does not address the user's primary focus on information retrieval and deep semantic understanding.

#### Abstract
> This full research paper investigates the impact of generative AI (GenAI) on
the learner experience, with a focus on how learners engage with and utilize
the information it provides. In e-learning environments, learners often need to
navigate a complex information space on their own. This challenge is further
compounded in interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics, due to the varied
prior knowledge and backgrounds. In this paper, we studied how GenAI influences
information search in bioinformatics research: (1) How do interactions with a
GenAI chatbot influence learner orienteering behaviors?; and (2) How do
learners identify information scent in GenAI chatbot responses? We adopted an
autoethnographic approach to investigate these questions. GenAI was found to
support orienteering once a learning plan was established, but it was
counterproductive prior to that. Moreover, traditionally value-rich information
sources such as bullet points and related terms proved less effective when
applied to GenAI responses. Information scents were primarily recognized
through the presence or absence of prior knowledge of the domain. These
findings suggest that GenAI should be adopted into e-learning environments with
caution, particularly in interdisciplinary learning contexts.

### 12. CompoST: A Benchmark for Analyzing the Ability of LLMs To Compositionally Interpret Questions in a QALD Setting

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21257v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-28 18:20:41
- **Comment**: Research Track, 24th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC
  2025), November 2-6, 2025, Nara, Japan
- **Topic Keywords**: queries
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on evaluating the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to compositionally interpret questions, which is not directly related to Information Retrieval (IR) or Search technologies. While it touches on query understanding and ranking models, the context is different and the techniques used are not applicable to IR. The paper's relevance to the user's interests is limited.

#### Abstract
> Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

### 13. UserBench: An Interactive Gym Environment for User-Centric Agents

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22034v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 17:34:12
- **Comment**: 25 Pages, 17 Figures, 6 Tables
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating user-centric agents, focusing on multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. While it touches on query understanding and user behavior modeling, the primary focus is on agent collaboration and task execution, which is not directly related to my research interests in information retrieval and search technologies.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

### 14. Post-Training Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback

- **Authors**: Carel van Niekerk, Renato Vukovic, Benjamin Matthias Ruppik, Hsien-chin Lin, Milica Ga≈°iƒá
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21931v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 15:46:26
- **Topic Keywords**: rank, search
- **Reason**: The paper discusses post-training techniques for large language models, focusing on reinforcement learning from self-feedback. While it touches on model behavior and uncertainty, it does not directly relate to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding, which are core areas of interest. The paper's focus on language models and their calibration is somewhat relevant to NLP, but the connection to the user's research is limited.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated
answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present
Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that
uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans
learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several
chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final
answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are
then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,
similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally
curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --
restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step
reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and
multiple-choice question answering.
  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms
reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and
data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further
research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 14:12:28
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for tool-integrated reasoning, which is a novel approach. However, it does not directly relate to query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest in Information Retrieval. While it touches on the theme of language models and their capabilities, it does not specifically address search technologies or real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented
post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by
incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid,
predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence.
Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR,
a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide
whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than
following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward
mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,
structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby
encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive
evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general
language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall
performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior
generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of
reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR
capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at

- **Comment**: May 2023, 6 pages, 5 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend, search
- **Reason**: The paper proposes a recommender system for movie recommendations, leveraging ChatGPT's NLP capabilities to analyze movie descriptions. While it touches on semantic information and knowledge graphs, the focus is on movie recommendations rather than information retrieval or search technologies. The paper's relevance to the user's interests is limited, as it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> The importance of recommender systems on the web has grown, especially in the
movie industry, with a vast selection of options to watch. To assist users in
traversing available items and finding relevant results, recommender systems
analyze operational data and investigate users' tastes and habits. Providing
highly individualized suggestions can boost user engagement and satisfaction,
which is one of the fundamental goals of the movie industry, significantly in
online platforms. According to recent studies and research, using
knowledge-based techniques and considering the semantic ideas of the textual
data is a suitable way to get more appropriate results. This study provides a
new method for building a knowledge graph based on semantic information. It
uses the ChatGPT, as a large language model, to assess the brief descriptions
of movies and extract their tone of voice. Results indicated that using the
proposed method may significantly enhance accuracy rather than employing the
explicit genres supplied by the publishers.

- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 02:03:37
- **Topic Keywords**: search
- **Reason**: The paper explores the application of large language models in transportation research, specifically for mode choice behavior prediction. While it touches on some related topics like natural language processing and machine learning, the focus is on a specific domain (transportation) and does not directly align with the user's primary research interests in information retrieval, search technologies, and query understanding.

#### Abstract
> This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable
causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and
introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task.
We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated
and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating
over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we
evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a
novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of
how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory.
LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy,
achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of
0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems,
including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading,
while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice
models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual
improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional
calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally
deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through
combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning,
this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models
capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural
insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general
purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research
and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and
broadening access through local deployment.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on extracting structured information from text, which is related to information retrieval, but it does not specifically address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. The paper's emphasis on benchmark generation and evaluation is also not directly relevant to my research interests.

#### Abstract
> Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.

While it mentions multi-modal retrieval, it's not applied to the context of search or e-commerce, and the techniques used are not relevant to ranking models or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have improved multi-modal understanding
and visual question answering (VQA), but still suffer from hallucinated
answers. Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps address these
issues by incorporating external information, yet challenges remain in visual
context comprehension, multi-source retrieval, and multi-turn interactions. To
address these challenges, Meta constructed the CRAG-MM benchmark and launched
the CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, which consists of three tasks. This
paper describes the solutions of all tasks in Meta KDD Cup'25 from BlackPearl
team. We use a single model for each task, with key methods including data
augmentation, RAG, reranking, and multi-task fine-tuning. Our solution achieve
automatic evaluation rankings of 3rd, 3rd, and 1st on the three tasks, and win
second place in Task3 after human evaluation.

- **Topic Keywords**: relevance, rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on cross-cultural recipe adaptation, which is not directly related to the user's research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. Although it mentions Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the context is specific to recipe adaptation and does not align with the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural
appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide
diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real
recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language
models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can
generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to
overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to
produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This
reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:
it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To
address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for
cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and
context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that
explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user
preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in
terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book
LLMs.

- **Topic Keywords**: queries, rag, recommend, search
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on optimizing short-term memory management for large language model agents in multi-turn conversations, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. Although it mentions 'tool removal ratios' and 'task completion accuracy', the context is unrelated to the user's primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous
capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context
windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated,
independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework
enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across
multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1)
Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow
Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode,
combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode
across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100
consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory
efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning
LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average),
while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%).
Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas
Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and
recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model
capabilities.

- **Submitted**: 2025-07-29 15:51:44
- **Topic Keywords**: query, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on high-dimensional indexing and file-based implementation of a disk-based ANN index, which is not directly related to information retrieval, query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. While it mentions disk-based indexes, the context is more about efficient storage and memory management rather than search technologies or semantic understanding.

#### Abstract
> Modern analytical pipelines routinely deploy multiple deep learning and
retrieval models that rely on approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) indexes to
support efficient similarity-based search. While many state-of-the-art
ANN-indexes are memory-based (e.g., HNSW and IVF), using multiple ANN indexes
creates a competition for limited GPU/CPU memory resources, which in turn
necessitates disk-based index structures (e.g., DiskANN or eCP). In typical
index implementations, the main component is a complex data structure that is
serialized to disk and is read either fully at startup time, for memory-based
indexes, or incrementally at query time, for disk-based indexes. To visualize
the index structure, or analyze its quality, complex coding is needed that is
either embedded in the index implementation or replicates the code that reads
the data structure. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach that
maps the data structure to a file structure, using a file library, making the
index easily readable for any programming language and even human-readable. The
disadvantage is that the serialized index is verbose, leading to overhead of
searching through the index. The question addressed in this paper is how severe
this performance penalty is. To that end, this paper presents eCP-FS, a
file-based implementation of eCP, a well-known disk-based ANN index. A
comparison with state-of-the-art indexes shows that while eCP-FS is slower, the
implementation is nevertheless somewhat competitive even when memory is not
constrained. In a memory-constrained scenario, eCP-FS offers a minimal memory
footprint, making it ideal for resource-constrained or multi-index
environments.

While it involves natural language processing, the application is not in the context of search or retrieval, and the techniques used are not relevant to query understanding, ranking models, or click models.

#### Abstract
> We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations. In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports
different types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired
preference data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation
perspectives: text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall
ranking. Empirical results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms
conventional and MLLM-based methods in generating human-aligned scores for
automatic evaluations and inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

The paper focuses on clinical text classification, transformer-based models, and explainability, which are not central to your areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated
retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates
whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to
improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that
automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based
clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site
diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649
electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for
extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to
measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that
clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance
in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are
limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also
leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were
consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This
suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance
and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is
optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports
rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,
training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify
rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as
additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only
slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale
coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

While it mentions image-to-text retrieval, the context is different from the user's primary focus on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual
benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with
64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

The paper's emphasis on recommendation and content control duties is also not a central match for the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and
online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation
and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of
large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky
for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in
real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce
a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by
translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large
language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation
and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural
flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity
recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41
datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.
In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary
Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in
embedding tasks. Datasets are available at HuggingFace:

While it touches on sequence-level knowledge distillation, the context is translation models rather than ranking models or user behavior modeling, making it only loosely relevant to the user's research themes.

#### Abstract
> This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of
multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the
teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student,
beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard
decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a
sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source
sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model
distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side
prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's
learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low
variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource
languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly
compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they
enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness.
This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender
bias amplification often associated with KD.

While the paper touches on the concept of semantic alignment, it does not address the user's specific areas of interest, such as ranking models, user behavior modeling, or real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly
believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather
than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual
knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this
work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized
data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the
model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a
semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on
a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8
LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the
semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,
semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising
finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and
possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

Although it involves language models, the context and tasks are specific to harm reduction and substance use, which is not a primary focus of the user's research.

#### Abstract
> Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance
use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their
health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the
information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in
relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction
information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160
question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety
boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use
risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours
based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate
harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to
PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously

While the paper mentions a hierarchical framework, it does not address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> Chart annotations enhance visualization accessibility but suffer from
fragmented, non-standardized representations that limit cross-platform reuse.
We propose ChartMark, a structured grammar that separates annotation semantics
from visualization implementations. ChartMark features a hierarchical framework
mapping onto annotation dimensions (e.g., task, chart context), supporting both
abstract intents and precise visual details. Our toolkit demonstrates
converting ChartMark specifications into Vega-Lite visualizations, highlighting
its flexibility, expressiveness, and practical applicability.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on automatic speech recognition (ASR) and transformer-based architectures, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. Although it mentions decoding speed and accuracy, the context is specific to ASR and does not align with the user's primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer
architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and
robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally
expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained
devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller
draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main
model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware
accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting},
a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model.
Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from
domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with
minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in
structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the
CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading
recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute
improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU,
highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

The paper's emphasis on task diversity and confidence weighting is not aligned with the user's research themes, and the e-commerce domain is not mentioned.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized
applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the
label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging
task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is
markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our
approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts
are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying
levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple
yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an
inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or
better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being
significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,
our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better
accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score).
Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our
algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing
methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on developing a novel recurrent neural network architecture inspired by biological neural systems, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. While it explores deep learning models, the paper's primary concern is interpretability and transparency in neural networks, which is not a key aspect of my research interests.

#### Abstract
> Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network
architectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their
interpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast,
biological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e.,
engrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated
sparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we
introduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture
incorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity
and sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models
memory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving
transparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We
evaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit
classification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language
modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and
generalization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM
architectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on
the large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant
enhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian
trace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory
formation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired
mechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep
learning models.

While it touches on the topic of token pruning, it does not address ranking models, user behavior modeling, or deep semantic understanding, making it only loosely relevant to the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

- **Reason**: This paper is not relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The paper focuses on large language models and their biases in capturing cross-cultural differences in moral perspectives, which is outside your primary research areas.

#### Abstract
> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as
powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about
embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their
training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal
consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which
LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.
Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in
international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three
complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by
models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment
analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM
outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative
prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that
current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral
variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with
empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more
robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in
LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible
development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical
alignment.

While it touches on SEO optimization, it does not explore ranking models or user behavior modeling, making it only loosely relevant to the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> URI redirections are integral to web management, supporting structural
changes, SEO optimization, and security. However, their complexities affect
usability, SEO performance, and digital preservation. This study analyzed 11
million unique redirecting URIs, following redirections up to 10 hops per URI,
to uncover patterns and implications of redirection practices. Our findings
revealed that 50% of the URIs terminated successfully, while 50% resulted in
errors, including 0.06% exceeding 10 hops. Canonical redirects, such as HTTP to
HTTPS transitions, were prevalent, reflecting adherence to SEO best practices.
Non-canonical redirects, often involving domain or path changes, highlighted
significant web migrations, rebranding, and security risks. Notable patterns
included "sink" URIs, where multiple redirects converged, ranging from traffic
consolidation by global websites to deliberate "Rickrolling." The study also
identified 62,000 custom 404 URIs, almost half being soft 404s, which could
compromise SEO and user experience. These findings underscore the critical role
of URI redirects in shaping the web while exposing challenges such as outdated
URIs, server instability, and improper error handling. This research offers a
detailed analysis of URI redirection practices, providing insights into their
prevalence, types, and outcomes. By examining a large dataset, we highlight
inefficiencies in redirection chains and examine patterns such as the use of
"sink" URIs and custom error pages. This information can help webmasters,
researchers, and digital archivists improve web usability, optimize resource
allocation, and safeguard valuable online content.

The paper focuses on automated coding with LLMs in the computational social sciences, which is a different domain and does not align with the user's primary focus on information retrieval and deep semantic understanding.

#### Abstract
> LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated
coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed
different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and
tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose
HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable
construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting
the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM
coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts
to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies
and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When
compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM
Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM
to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our
paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting
strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable
prompts for each coding task and model.

Although it touches on multilingual scenarios, the topic is more aligned with NLP and AI safety, rather than the user's primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors
is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models
or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety
classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue.
Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves,
there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety
classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in
multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual
disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets
covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the
evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety
classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these
findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to
identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

The topic of Automatic Speech Recognition for the Shona language is outside your scope, and the paper does not address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are your primary areas of focus.

#### Abstract
> This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic
Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by
unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the
challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the
intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of
achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to
traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of
using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it
investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing
deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed
strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of
the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of
accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of
a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term
Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data
augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention
mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona
speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error
Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These
metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for
under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement
of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately
fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers
worldwide.

Although it involves natural language processing, the specific application and methodology are not aligned with the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping
public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify
hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural
language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without
effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing
serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research
fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,
designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate
its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement
semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use
LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making
process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy
score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to
our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of
transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the
door to further improvements in this area.
