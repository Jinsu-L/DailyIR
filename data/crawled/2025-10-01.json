        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)\ntrained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected\nper-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM\nconvergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a\nfour-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a\nsharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a\nslow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge\nfaster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually\nreconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to\nlearn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token\nfrequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is\nuneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words\nconverge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens\nand content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the\nstability of the learned distributions in model training.",

        "title": "Scaling Spoken Language Models with Syllabic Speech Tokenization",
        "abstract": "Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into\nhigh-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful\nLMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token\nstreams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically\nwith sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of\nspeech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more\nscalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their\nvalue for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the\nfirst systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,\nevaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data\nscale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens\nwhile significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a\n2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings\nhighlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient\nlong-context spoken language models.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL\n(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.\nHowever, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,\nboth in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce\na novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for\nreasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting\nhigh attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch\nfrom positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling\nstrategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,\nensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To\nfurther improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training\npipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior\napproaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.",

At the scale of the Internet, there are tens\nof thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing\nand evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally\ninfeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit\nproblem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a\ncost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its\ndifficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics\nwithin a fixed computational budget.

LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the\nbenchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English\ntranslation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs\nfor translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated\ntest data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),\nwith their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a\nbenchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the\nsource language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English\ntranslation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of\nEnglish translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text\nis one attribution to self bias.

Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models\nto translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to\nproduce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that\nreasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often\nfail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical\nvisual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning\n(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through\ninteraction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training\nreveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we\ncreate pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to\nsolve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4\npoints over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%\nif those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit\nsupervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be\neffectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit\nannotations.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but\ncontinue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack\nvectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable\nto fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive\ndemographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect\noutcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible\nyet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a\nstrategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text\ngeneration. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the\nretrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts\nfairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled\ndemographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis\nperformed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace\n(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),\neach integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic\nvariations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed\nanalysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with\nperturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the\nviolations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work\nreinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to\nprevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for\ndevelopers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs\nwithout compromising fairness or reliability.",

We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework\nthat evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key\nidea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG\nwhere nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one\nfunction consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function\nschemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose\nthe correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows\nusers to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,\nand distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our\nFuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying\ndifficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose\nmodels with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance\ndeclines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected\nirrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong\nmodels often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or\nstale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in\nmulti-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple\nmitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent\nat each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains\nacross models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%\nfor GPT-5.",

In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE\n(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly\ninto the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated\nexperts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:\ntop-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained\ncapabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.\nWe explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise\nrandomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that\na single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at\nvarious expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist\nmodels, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not\nonly unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by\nallocating different computational budgets to different model layers.

However, existing approaches\noften underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically\nfailing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This\nlimitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for\ncontrollable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm\ninspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from\nspeech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a\n``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual\n``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS\nmodel, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To\nrealize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically\nfor this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong\nperformance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming\nstrong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables\nremarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature\ncontrol abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates\nthat objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively\nunlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.",

Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store\nconsumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the\nmost complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.\nThrough a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable\nflexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario\ntasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from\nmultiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and\nspatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous\ninstructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn\nconversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,\nenabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments\nand stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the\nmost advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and\nless than 50% success rate on others.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making.",

At its core,\nCreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge\ngraph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic\nrealization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic\ntriples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an\nInitialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a\nGeneration Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent\ndialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages\nthis prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as\nretrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy\nand overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation.

        "abstract": "Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned\nsummaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence\namong attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated\nconstraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require\nper-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary\nattributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute\ncontrollable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the\ntask as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions\ncorrespond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of\nonly the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively\ndiscovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that\neffectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains\nand models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute\ncontrollability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned\nbaselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the\nmuch larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior\ncontrol performance, outperforming all competitors.",

        "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable\nperformance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent\nsequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose\nFast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that\nefficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text\ngeneration, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This\nrepresents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention\ndiffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original\nmodel's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that\ncombines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,\nenabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR\ntraining objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical\ncaching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context\nrepresentations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient\nparallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel\ndecoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR\ndecoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR\nbaselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs\n- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and\naccurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of\nthoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally\ncostly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent\nthinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning\nsteps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack\ninterpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the\ncorrectness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we\nprovide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and\nhow external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We\nshow that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit\nhighly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably\npredict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these\ninsights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic\nalgorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to\noptimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse\nreasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect\nlatent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking\nprocesses. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,\nand LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking\nprocesses. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward\nmodeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed\ndirectly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,\nefficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of\nLLMs.",

        "abstract": "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large\nlanguage models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to\nreinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance\ndisparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental\ndifference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes\non-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we\nintroduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides\nSFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning\nprocess by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement\nlearning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by\nsampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The\nground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward\nsignal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes\nstatic, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the\ntoken level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while\nbypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive\nexperiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical\nreasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that\nOTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a\npowerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling\nevidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of\ngeneralization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.",

Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot\nArena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer \"better\"\npersonality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model\nresponses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight\nlimitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was\nrolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed\noverfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,\nlimited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality.

        "abstract": "The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on\ntransformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of\ndistinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As\nLLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and\nresembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less\neffective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with\nnew models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes\nVietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global\nthresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have\nconstructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal\nthresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our\nexperiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\\% in all two\ndomains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets.

        "abstract": "Modeling sequential user behaviors for future behavior prediction is crucial\nin improving user's information retrieval experience. Recent studies highlight\nthe importance of incorporating contextual information to enhance prediction\nperformance. One crucial but usually neglected contextual information is the\nscene feature which we define as sub-interfaces within an app, created by\ndevelopers to provide specific functionalities, such as ``text2product search\"\nand ``live\" modules in e-commence apps. Different scenes exhibit distinct\nfunctionalities and usage habits, leading to significant distribution gap in\nuser engagement across them. Popular sequential behavior models either ignore\nthe scene feature or merely use it as attribute embeddings, which cannot\neffectively capture the dynamic interests and interplay between scenes and\nitems when modeling user sequences. In this work, we propose a novel Dual\nSequence Prediction networks (DSPnet) to effectively capture the dynamic\ninterests and interplay between scenes and items for future behavior\nprediction. DSPnet consists of two parallel networks dedicated to learn users'\ndynamic interests over items and scenes, and a sequence feature enhancement\nmodule to capture the interplay for enhanced future behavior prediction.\nFurther, we introduce a Conditional Contrastive Regularization (CCR) loss to\ncapture the invariance of similar historical sequences. Theoretical analysis\nsuggests that DSPnet is a principled way to learn the joint relationships\nbetween scene and item sequences. Extensive experiments are conducted on one\npublic benchmark and two collected industrial datasets. The method has been\ndeployed online in our system, bringing a 0.04 point increase in CTR, 0.78\\%\ngrowth in deals, and 0.64\\% rise in GMV.

        "abstract": "Modern recommender systems place great inclination towards facilitating user\nexperience, as more applications enabling users to critique and then refine\nrecommendations immediately. Considering the real-time requirements,\ncritique-able recommender systems typically straight modify the model\nparameters and update the recommend list through analyzing the user critiquing\nkeyphrases in the inference phase. Current critiquing methods require first\nconstructing a specially designated model which establish direct correlations\nbetween users and keyphrases during the training phase allowing for innovative\nrecommendations upon the critiquing,restricting the applicable scenarios.\nAdditionally, all these approaches ignore the catastrophic forgetting problem,\nwhere the cumulative changes in parameters during continuous multi-step\ncritiquing may lead to a collapse in model performance. Thus, We conceptualize\na proxy bridging users and keyphrases, proposing a streamlined yet potent Items\nProxy Generic Critiquing Framework (IPGC) framework, which can serve as a\nuniversal plugin for most knowledge graph recommender models based on\ncollaborative filtering (CF) strategies. IPGC provides a new paradigm for\nfrictionless integration of critique mechanisms to enable iterative\nrecommendation refinement in mainstream recommendation scenarios. IPGC\ndescribes the items proxy mechanism for transforming the critiquing\noptimization objective of user-keyphrase pairs into user-item pairs, adapting\nit for general CF recommender models without the necessity of specifically\ndesigned user-keyphrase correlation module. Furthermore, an anti-forgetting\nregularizer is introduced in order to efficiently mitigate the catastrophic\nforgetting problem of the model as a prior for critiquing optimization.",

In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforced Strategy Optimization\n(RSO) method for CRS, which decomposes the process of generating\nstrategy-driven response decisions into the macro-level strategy planning and\nmicro-level strategy adaptation through a network-of-experts architecture. At\nthe macro level, a Planner expert selects macro-level interaction strategies\n(e.g., recommend, explain, encourage). At the micro level, an Actor expert\ngenerates detailed responses conditioned on the selected macro-level strategy,\nguided by auxiliary experts that provide complementary information such as user\npreferences and factual grounding. This hierarchical decomposition disentangles\nthe optimization of different sub-tasks involved in CRS response generation,\nenabling more tractable learning at each level. To address the scarcity of\nhigh-quality multi-turn training data, we formulate strategy learning as a\nreinforcement learning problem, guided by an LLM-based reward model to achieve\nautomatic strategy exploration.

        "abstract": "Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human\npreferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.\nExisting textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We\npropose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the\nLLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder\n(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By\nperforming controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to\nthe embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent\nsynthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We\nprovide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately\npreserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.\nEmpirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based\naugmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x\nfaster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to\nevaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative\nwriting. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality\nand explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that\ncurrent LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in\nthe prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for\nlong-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative\nwriting. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must\nchoose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100\npairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and\nGemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,\nwe assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source\nidentity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal\norigin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.\nResults reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency\nbias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear\nprovenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are\nespecially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended\nLitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost\nnever reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of\ncontent qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge\nsystems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as\nevaluators in both research and deployment.",

        "abstract": "Recommenders aim to rank items from a discrete item corpus in line with user\ninterests, yet suffer from extremely sparse user preference data. Recent\nadvances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which\nalleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the\ncollapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current\ndiffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise,\nwhich is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference\ndata in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in\ndiscrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based\nrecommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user\npreferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing\ndiffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of\npreference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item\npairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex.\nThis formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature\nof recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of\ninjecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the\npreferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling --\nthereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference\nreconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by\niteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios.\nPreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical\nguarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent\nperformance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across\nfive benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and\nempirical effectiveness.",

Most existing approaches rely on manually\ndesigned processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.\nWhile a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied\nto specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate\nfeedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their\noperations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these\nlimitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that\nadaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task\nrequirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an\nexecutor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals\ndefined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on\nintermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the\nexecutor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with\ncontext-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded\nreasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including\nsocial reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code\ngeneration.

Following prior work\non hinted vs.\\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT\nfaithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans\nfour datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models\n(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in\ncorrectness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data\nleak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator\nexpressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly\nacknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,\ncorrect hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks\nand logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks\nwith lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly\nuneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are\noften adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward\nverbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style\nmatters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style\nprompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect\nRLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data\nleak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that\nLLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure\nfaithfulness.",

        "abstract": "Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,\nstruggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require\njudging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user\nquery, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and\nconciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available\nRAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a\nmethodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference\npairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the\ntraining of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using\nRAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs\nranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on\nmuch larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement\nof +15.5%.",

        "abstract": "Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large\nlanguage models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing\nlatency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose\nContinuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and\ndifferentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or \"N:M\")\nsparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and\nweights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,\nwhile progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.\nSpecifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware\noptimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification\nacross all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the\nmagnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;\n3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to\nenhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns\nacross multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our\nresults demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art\nmethods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training\nresources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible\nperplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to\nthe dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,\nwe establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse\nmodel performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under\nquantization and fine-tuning scenarios.",

To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),\na plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by\nstrategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into\ntwo distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and\nlong-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear\ngradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize\nremaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent\nmodel collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp\nacross three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:\nreducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary\ntool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to\n52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance\nimpact.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming\ntasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current\ncode agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and\ntool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several\nchallenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and\ncustom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true\nunderlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and\nmaintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of\ndata leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI\nand Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'\ncoding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks\nconfidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),\nwhich operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while\nretaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a\nmore faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments\non the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita\nachieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and\nagentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires\nsignificantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient\nto reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose\nthe Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying\ncomplexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model\nimproves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.",

This\nuniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently\nsucceed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients\nduring training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.\nViewing each task's exploration as an \"item\" with a distinct \"value\" and\n\"cost\", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This\nformulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively\ndistributes resources based on the model's current learning status.

This enables significantly\nlarger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which\nwould be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation.

However, prior work has found that explanations can\neasily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy\nundesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two\ncomplementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring\nfunctions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an\nexplanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how\nwell the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's\nprediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these\nquality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than\nexisting explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants\nhave to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual\ncontext. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations\nimproves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,\nincluding a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect\npredictions.

An effective\nmid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable\nfast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by\npresenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes\npost-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the\nvalue approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent\nplanning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training\neffectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL\npolicy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which\nthat policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that\nmid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the\neffective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the\nspace of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these\ninsights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable\nmid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower\nbound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent\nstructures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.\nExperiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach.

        "abstract": "This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for\nautomated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities\nrelated to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks\n(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large\nlanguage models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical\ninterview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz\n(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to\nDNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot\ncounts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based\nmodels in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups\nsuch as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared\nto DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among\nfairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the\nworst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing\ndemographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.\nIn contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but\nperforms less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps\nmitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of\nshots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,\nneither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively\nreduces disparities.",

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on\nfactoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and\nuntruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their\nparametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --\nmodels must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid\nhallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:\napproaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those\nthat encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct\nanswers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we\npresent TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly\noptimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using\nGRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct\nanswers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce\nhallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling\nabstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive\nexperiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to\nvanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves\ntruthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models\n(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth\nablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as\nsupervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual\ncorrectness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven\nTruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,\nunderscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing\ntruthful LLMs.",

However, we argue that current large-scale\nreasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse\nmathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about\nwhether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles\nor merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down\ncomplex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by\nthis, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic\ncapabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)\nfield-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,\ngeometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different\nlevels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with\nformal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose\ncorresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,\nand conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities\ninfluence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific\natomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show\nmany interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances\nof models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic\ncapabilities.

APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in\nAI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically\nrelevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four\ndomains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical\ncare. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier\nexperience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created\nprompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts\ncreated rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models\non APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest\nmean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking =\nOn) (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B is the best performing open-source model and seventh\nbest overall. There is a large gap between the performance of even the best\nmodels and human experts, highlighting the need for better measurement of\nmodels' ability to produce economically valuable work.",

However, existing methods rely on\noversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via\nbasic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the\ncomplex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and\nhallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework\nto incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO\nvia the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in\nCLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse\nautoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative\nsamples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation\nfrom the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative\nsupervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce\nobjective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training\nefficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that\nMISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,\nvalidating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in\npreference-based learning.",

In other words, they can only improve performance on\nproblems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.\nConsequently, the model's \"upper limit\" remains unchanged after RL training,\neven though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.\nThese hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards\nand thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,\nwe propose NuRL, a \"nudging\" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM\nreasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the\nproblem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the\nmodel generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge\nneeded to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the\nbase policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be\ninjected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and\nregenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint\nboosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals\nfor previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,\navoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves\nconsistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining\ncomplementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper\nlimit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.\nFurthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and\nwhen hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and\nhigh-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has\nconverged.",

In this work,\nwe study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We\nfully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to\nbe represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,\nthese include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally\napproximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These\nproperties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part\nof their Fr\\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that\nthe solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,\nfor interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy\nproblem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be\napproximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the\nmeasure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the\ninfinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with\na Vlasov flow.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in\nlarge-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further\nimproving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning\nprocess step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models\ntypically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each\nintermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation\nis in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked\nsentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a\nprincipled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without\nexplicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process\nreward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the\nenhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been\npost-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).\nWe provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided\nsampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation\nbenchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training\nmethods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and\nmodel types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%.

In controlled experiments\nusing the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at\n130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),\nmodels trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive\ndatasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting\nthey surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.\nPerformance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.\nThese results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a\npractical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing\nreliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.\nCode: https://github.com/ontocord/mixturevitae",

This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent\nin current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often\nmiss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the\nsolution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo\nTree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that\nrely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into\nthe training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit\nassignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,\nDeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,\nwhich leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training\nsteps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that\nprioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with\nentropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)\nadaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.\nExperiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves\n62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B\nreasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training\napproaches.

To address this, we propose\nthe Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level\nthinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.\nGiven a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the\nfaithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then\napplies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring\nreward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness\nevaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both\nexternal and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that\nTRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and\nincorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both\nanswer correctness and usefulness.",

        "abstract": "Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet\nprinciples governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the\n*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively\nevaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC\ncharacterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of\n*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models\nfrom 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low\npoints on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a\nTREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be\n*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling\nproactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training\nrecipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We\nalso align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual\npre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.",

        "title": "Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities",
        "abstract": "Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a\ntarget set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make\ntradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value\nconflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an\nautomatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a\nuser-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in\nwhich a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the\nset. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written \"user prompt\" and\nevaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the\nvalue set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended\nevaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,\nsuch as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user\nautonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including\ndetailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a\ntarget ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate\nsuccess at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates\nthe importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a\nfoundation for future work in this area.",

        "abstract": "This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal\nmodel representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text\nquality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,\nEffective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms\nmeasured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic\nDimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text\nnaturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models\nconsistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these\ngeometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text\ncharacteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a\nreference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated\ndatasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.",

        "abstract": "Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing\nmental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans\nprogress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this\ndevelopment before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,\nneural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from\nfirst- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like\nreasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as\nin humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could\nspontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on\nadvanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that\nsimulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM\ncompetence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed\naccuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when\ngeneralizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher\norders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These\nperceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.\nFurthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different\nparameter scales.
