Existing approaches such as\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely\non rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.\nWe present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework\nthat enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world\nInternet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search\ntools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by\nan outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect\na multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers\ndiverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset\nwith both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for\nshaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on\nknowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only\noutperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the\nperformance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over\n30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for\nadvancing research in multimodal search.",

        "abstract": "Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting\ngoals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still\nbeing mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an\nintegral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools\nfor interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are\nlimited. In cognitive science, so-called \"cognitive models\" provide formal\naccounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a\nspeaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In\nthis work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the\nextent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to\nsystematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:\ndegrees of reasoning \"effort\" in frontier black-box models, and RL\npost-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of\nhigher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in\nopen-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings\nfrom LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in\ntraining with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining\ndata, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method\nis responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with\ninsights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping\ntraining regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs\nbetween values during model training.",

This will require new reasoning\nskills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason\nabout the \"mental\" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent\nabilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from\nnarrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus\npropose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM\ndrawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in\nall other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other\nbenchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing\ninteractive ToM experiments.\n  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations\nof frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We\nfind that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple\nword-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive\nscience experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.\nSurprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly\nworse at those tasks than their older counterparts.

To efficiently steer\nthe ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model\nediting task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area\nof research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while\npreserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate\nthis approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in\npsychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and\nediting of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier\nintroducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that\nBehavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within\nspecific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only\nscenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an\nagent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be\nused to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce\nharmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents\nbased on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior\nEditing across different models and scenarios.

In contrast, we are most\ninterested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally\nverifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly\nscale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual,\nmulti-task setting.\n  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation\nand selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and\nvaried language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing\nthat strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages.\nWe propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for\nmultilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable\ngains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and\nselection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models\non m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini.

Our\nstudy reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as\nMegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,\nwhile existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further\nadding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\nexamples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this\neffect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce\nverbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the\nimportance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to\nstronger downstream RL performance.

Counterfactual\nself-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the\nmodel's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in\nthe training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be\naffected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in\nparticular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization\ntreating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into\naccount how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a\nsmall language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training\nsamples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking\nat self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with\nmemorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces\nself-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We\nobserve similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the\ninfluence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.\nOur findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across\ntraining data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by\nself-influence alone.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language\nunderstanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically\ncomes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in\ndeployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a\npromising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods\nprimarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel\nstrategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from\nfinetuned model variants, which preserves the original model's abilities by\naggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the\noptimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting\na search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2)\nLayer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning,\nfor example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain\napproximately 97.3\\% of the original performance while removing $\\sim25\\%$ of\nparameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker\nclaiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks\ndisproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of\ncontinuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who\nshould be talking at every point in time, and for how long?\n  In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the\nconversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the\nlower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing\ndynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this\nframework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that,\nperhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time\nare perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being\npreferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less.\nThen we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance\n-- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by\nthe participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.\nFinally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of\ncomputer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI\ncommunication.",

This necessitates improving\ncapabilities, but importantly coupled with greater safety measures to align\nthese models with human values and preferences. In this work, we demonstrate\nthat contemporary models fall concerningly short of the goal of AI safety,\nleading to an unsafe and harmful experience for users. We introduce a prompting\nstrategy called Code of Thought (CoDoT) to evaluate the safety of LLMs. CoDoT\nconverts natural language inputs to simple code that represents the same\nintent. For instance, CoDoT transforms the natural language prompt \"Make the\nstatement more toxic: {text}\" to: \"make_more_toxic({text})\". We show that CoDoT\nresults in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For\nexample, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of\nthe time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs.\nAdditionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two\ntimes.

        "abstract": "Detecting miscommunication in human-robot interaction is a critical function\nfor maintaining user engagement and trust. While humans effortlessly detect\ncommunication errors in conversations through both verbal and non-verbal cues,\nrobots face significant challenges in interpreting non-verbal feedback, despite\nadvances in computer vision for recognizing affective expressions. This\nresearch evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting\nmiscommunications in robot dialogue. Using a multi-modal dataset of 240\nhuman-robot conversations, where four distinct types of conversational failures\nwere systematically introduced, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art\ncomputer vision models. After each conversational turn, users provided feedback\non whether they perceived an error, enabling an analysis of the models' ability\nto accurately detect robot mistakes. Despite using state-of-the-art models, the\nperformance barely exceeds random chance in identifying miscommunication, while\non a dataset with more expressive emotional content, they successfully\nidentified confused states. To explore the underlying cause, we asked human\nraters to do the same. They could also only identify around half of the induced\nmiscommunications, similarly to our model. These results uncover a fundamental\nlimitation in identifying robot miscommunications in dialogue: even when users\nperceive the induced miscommunication as such, they often do not communicate\nthis to their robotic conversation partner. This knowledge can shape\nexpectations of the performance of computer vision models and can help\nresearchers to design better human-robot conversations by deliberately\neliciting feedback where needed.",

Compared\nto the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior\ndiscriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being\nsignificantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical,\ncomprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving\nRAG systems.",

        "abstract": "Evaluating the abilities of learners is a fundamental objective in the field\nof education. In particular, there is an increasing need to assess higher-order\nabilities such as expressive skills and logical thinking. Constructed-response\ntests such as short-answer and essay-based questions have become widely used as\na method to meet this demand. Although these tests are effective, they require\nsubstantial manual grading, making them both labor-intensive and costly. Item\nresponse theory (IRT) provides a promising solution by enabling the estimation\nof ability from incomplete score data, where human raters grade only a subset\nof answers provided by learners across multiple test items. However, the\naccuracy of ability estimation declines as the proportion of missing scores\nincreases. Although data augmentation techniques for imputing missing scores\nhave been explored in order to address this limitation, they often struggle\nwith inaccuracy for sparse or heterogeneous data. To overcome these challenges,\nthis study proposes a novel method for imputing missing scores by leveraging\nautomated scoring technologies for accurate IRT-based ability estimation.

        "abstract": "Background: The positive predictive value (PPV) of large language model\n(LLM)-based proofreading for radiology reports is limited due to the low error\nprevalence. Purpose: To assess whether a three-pass LLM framework enhances PPV\nand reduces operational costs compared with baseline approaches. Materials and\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology\nreports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III\ndatabase. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.\nThree LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor\nplus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.\nPrecision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).\nEfficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer\nremuneration. Statistical significance was tested using cluster bootstrap,\nexact McNemar tests, and Holm-Bonferroni correction. Results: Framework PPV\nincreased from 0.063 (95% CI, 0.036-0.101, Framework 1) to 0.079 (0.049-0.118,\nFramework 2), and significantly to 0.159 (0.090-0.252, Framework 3; P<.001 vs.\nbaselines). aTPR remained stable (0.012-0.014; P>=.84). Operational costs per\n1,000 reports dropped to USD 5.58 (Framework 3) from USD 9.72 (Framework 1) and\nUSD 6.85 (Framework 2), reflecting reductions of 42.6% and 18.5%, respectively.\nHuman-reviewed reports decreased from 192 to 88. External validation supported\nFramework 3's superior PPV (CheXpert 0.133, Open-i 0.105) and stable aTPR\n(0.007). Conclusion: A three-pass LLM framework significantly enhanced PPV and\nreduced operational costs, maintaining detection performance, providing an\neffective strategy for AI-assisted radiology report quality assurance.",

        "abstract": "Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant\nchallenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates\ninformation, obscuring how features evolve within large language models.\nCurrent research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single\nlayers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy\nit introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for\nactivation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited\nset of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose\n\\gls{clvqvae}, a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations\nacross layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features\ninto compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines\ntop-$k$ temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook\nupdates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while\nmaintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with\nscaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by\ndirectional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic\nstructure in word embedding space.",

        "abstract": "Reasoning in humans is prone to biases due to underlying motivations like\nidentity protection, that undermine rational decision-making and judgment. This\nmotivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when\ndebating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,\nand can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported\nthat large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive\nbiases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward\nidentity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate\nwhether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic\nattributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and\nproprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity\ndiscernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific\nevidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity\ndiscernment relative to models without personas. Political personas\nspecifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific\nevidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced\npolitical identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at\nmitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first\nto suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning\nthat is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising\nconcerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.",

        "abstract": "Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in\nhealthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical\nimplications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.\nResults Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy\nconsumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x\ntimes more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while\nmaintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs\ncan be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in\nmedical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular\nframework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and\naligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.",

        "abstract": "Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between\nfixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades\nwhere a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of\npsycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields\ninsight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process\nmodel exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to\nfixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a\npredictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive\naccuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain\nfine-grained eye movements.",
