        "title": "Topic-Specific Classifiers are Better Relevance Judges than Prompted LLMs",
        "abstract": "The unjudged document problem, where pooled test collections have incomplete\nrelevance judgments for evaluating new retrieval systems, is a key obstacle to\nthe reusability of test collections in information retrieval. While the de\nfacto standard to deal with the problem is to treat unjudged documents as\nnon-relevant, many alternatives have been proposed, including the use of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as a relevance judge (LLM-as-a-judge). However, this has\nbeen criticized as circular, since the same LLM can be used as a judge and as a\nranker at the same time. We propose to train topic-specific relevance\nclassifiers instead: By finetuning monoT5 with independent LoRA weight\nadaptation on the judgments of a single assessor for a single topic's pool, we\nalign it to that assessor's notion of relevance for the topic. The system\nrankings obtained through our classifier's relevance judgments achieve a\nSpearmans' $\\rho$ correlation of $>0.95$ with ground truth system rankings. As\nlittle as 128 initial human judgments per topic suffice to improve the\ncomparability of models, compared to treating unjudged documents as\nnon-relevant, while achieving more reliability than existing LLM-as-a-judge\napproaches. Topic-specific relevance classifiers thus are a lightweight and\nstraightforward way to tackle the unjudged document problem, while maintaining\nhuman judgments as the gold standard for retrieval evaluation.

        "title": "Guided Query Refinement: Multimodal Hybrid Retrieval with Test-Time Optimization",
        "abstract": "Multimodal encoders have pushed the boundaries of visual document retrieval,\nmatching textual query tokens directly to image patches and achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks. Recent models relying on\nthis paradigm have massively scaled the sizes of their query and document\nrepresentations, presenting obstacles to deployment and scalability in\nreal-world pipelines. Furthermore, purely vision-centric approaches may be\nconstrained by the inherent modality gap still exhibited by modern\nvision-language models. In this work, we connect these challenges to the\nparadigm of hybrid retrieval, investigating whether a lightweight dense text\nretriever can enhance a stronger vision-centric model. Existing hybrid methods,\nwhich rely on coarse-grained fusion of ranks or scores, fail to exploit the\nrich interactions within each model's representation space. To address this, we\nintroduce Guided Query Refinement (GQR), a novel test-time optimization method\nthat refines a primary retriever's query embedding using guidance from a\ncomplementary retriever's scores. Through extensive experiments on visual\ndocument retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that GQR allows vision-centric\nmodels to match the performance of models with significantly larger\nrepresentations, while being up to 14x faster and requiring 54x less memory.\nOur findings show that GQR effectively pushes the Pareto frontier for\nperformance and efficiency in multimodal retrieval.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enriching\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, allowing for factually\ngrounded responses, a critical requirement in high-stakes domains such as\nhealthcare. However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by\nthe performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically\nmisaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated\nresponse. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced\nlanguage of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is\noften achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to\naddress this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval\narchitecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for\nefficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model\nfor fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our\nretriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical\ncontext, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from\nPubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of\nthe ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points\ncompared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical\nRAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on\nthe five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong\nbaselines such as MedCPT (0.4436).

        "abstract": "RAG systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains where users\nexpect outputs to be consistent across semantically equivalent queries.\nHowever, existing systems often exhibit significant inconsistencies due to\nvariability in both the retriever and generator (LLM), undermining trust and\nreliability. In this work, we focus on information consistency, i.e., the\nrequirement that outputs convey the same core content across semantically\nequivalent inputs. We introduce a principled evaluation framework that\ndecomposes RAG consistency into retriever-level, generator-level, and\nend-to-end components, helping identify inconsistency sources. To improve\nconsistency, we propose Paraphrased Set Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(PS-GRPO), an RL approach that leverages multiple rollouts across paraphrased\nset to assign group similarity rewards. We leverage PS-GRPO to achieve\nInformation Consistent RAG (Con-RAG), training the generator to produce\nconsistent outputs across paraphrased queries and remain robust to\nretrieval-induced variability. Because exact reward computation over paraphrase\nsets is computationally expensive, we also introduce a scalable approximation\nmethod that retains effectiveness while enabling efficient, large-scale\ntraining. Empirical evaluations across short-form, multi-hop, and long-form QA\nbenchmarks demonstrate that Con-RAG significantly improves both consistency and\naccuracy over strong baselines, even in the absence of explicit ground-truth\nsupervision.

With average\nscores of 85.6% and 84.2%, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 (the two top-performing\nmodels) not only achieve gold medal level performance but also rank in the top\ntwo among ~200-300 participants in all four IOAA theory exams evaluated\n(2022-2025).

Prior\nworks such as Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and Multi-Latent Attention (MLA)\nshrink the cache, speeding decode, but leave compute, which determines prefill\nand training speed, largely unchanged. We introduce Compressed Convolutional\nAttention (CCA), a novel attention method which down-projects queries, keys,\nand values and performs the entire attention operation inside the shared latent\nspace. This simple design dramatically cuts parameters, KV-cache, and FLOPs all\nat once by the desired compression factor. Because CCA is orthogonal to\nhead-sharing, we combine the two to form Compressed Convolutional Grouped Query\nAttention (CCGQA), which further tightens the compute-bandwidth Pareto frontier\nso that users can tune compression toward either FLOP or memory limits without\nsacrificing quality. Experiments show that CCGQA consistently outperforms both\nGQA and MLA at equal KV-cache compression on dense and MoE models.\nAdditionally, we show that CCGQA outperforms all other attention methods on MoE\nmodels with half the KV-cache of GQA and MLA, achieving an 8x KV-cache\ncompression with no drop in performance compared to standard MHA. CCA and CCGQA\nalso dramatically reduce the FLOP cost of attention which leads to\nsubstantially faster training and prefill than existing methods.

        "abstract": "Prevailing methods for training Large Language Models (LLMs) as text encoders\nrely on contrastive losses that treat the model as a black box function,\ndiscarding its generative and reasoning capabilities in favor of static\nembeddings. We introduce GRACE (Generative Representation Learning via\nContrastive Policy Optimization), a novel framework that reimagines contrastive\nsignals not as losses to be minimized, but as rewards that guide a generative\npolicy. In GRACE, the LLM acts as a policy that produces explicit,\nhuman-interpretable rationales--structured natural language explanations of its\nsemantic understanding. These rationales are then encoded into high-quality\nembeddings via mean pooling. Using policy gradient optimization, we train the\nmodel with a multi-component reward function that maximizes similarity between\nquery positive pairs and minimizes similarity with negatives. This transforms\nthe LLM from an opaque encoder into an interpretable agent whose reasoning\nprocess is transparent and inspectable. On MTEB benchmark, GRACE yields broad\ncross category gains: averaged over four backbones, the supervised setting\nimproves overall score by 11.5% over base models, and the unsupervised variant\nadds 6.9%, while preserving general capabilities. This work treats contrastive\nobjectives as rewards over rationales, unifying representation learning with\ngeneration to produce stronger embeddings and transparent rationales.

Current defenses, primarily reactive and static, often\nfail to counter these search-based attacks. In this paper, we introduce ProAct,\na novel proactive defense framework designed to disrupt and mislead autonomous\njailbreaking processes. Our core idea is to intentionally provide adversaries\nwith \"spurious responses\" that appear to be results of successful jailbreak\nattacks but contain no actual harmful content. These misleading responses\nprovide false signals to the attacker's internal optimization loop, causing the\nadversarial search to terminate prematurely and effectively jailbreaking the\njailbreak. By conducting extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs,\njailbreaking frameworks, and safety benchmarks, our method consistently and\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates by up to 92\\%. When combined with\nother defense frameworks, it further reduces the success rate of the latest\nattack strategies to 0\\%. ProAct represents an orthogonal defense strategy that\ncan serve as an additional guardrail to enhance LLM safety against the most\neffective jailbreaking attacks.",

Small shifts in user behavior, such as being more\nimpatient, incoherent, or skeptical, can cause sharp drops in agent\nperformance, revealing how brittle current AI agents are. Today's benchmarks\nfail to capture this fragility: agents may perform well under standard\nevaluations but degrade spectacularly in more realistic and varied settings. We\naddress this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,\nmodel-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis\nlearns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits\n(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,\nand applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using\nTraitBasis, we extend $\\tau$-Bench to $\\tau$-Trait, where user behaviors are\naltered via controlled trait vectors. We observe on average a 2%-30%\nperformance degradation on $\\tau$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting\nthe lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior.\nTogether, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing\nand the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional\ntool. By powering simulation-driven stress tests and training loops, TraitBasis\nopens the door to building AI agents that remain reliable in the unpredictable\ndynamics of real-world human interactions.

Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges,\nespecially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the\nsearch distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses\nprobability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single\nhigh-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking\npersists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency.\nTo address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework\nfor LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning\ndynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by\nblock-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token\ndistributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely\nconvergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches,\nSwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying\nproblem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks,\nSwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across\nreasoning LLMs of different model families and scales.

MAVE achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nspeech editing and very competitive results in zero-shot TTS, while not being\nexplicitly trained on the latter task, outperforming leading autoregressive and\ndiffusion models on diverse, real-world audio. By integrating Mamba for\nefficient audio sequence modeling with cross-attention for precise\ntext-acoustic alignment, MAVE enables context-aware voice editing with\nexceptional naturalness and speaker consistency. In pairwise human evaluations\non a random 40-sample subset of the RealEdit benchmark (400 judgments), 57.2%\nof listeners rated MAVE - edited speech as perceptually equal to the original,\nwhile 24.8% prefered the original and 18.0% MAVE - demonstrating that in the\nmajority of cases edits are indistinguishable from the source. MAVE compares\nfavorably with VoiceCraft and FluentSpeech both on pairwise comparisons and\nstandalone mean opinion score (MOS) evaluations. For zero-shot TTS, MAVE\nexceeds VoiceCraft in both speaker similarity and naturalness, without\nrequiring multiple inference runs or post-processing. Remarkably, these quality\ngains come with a significantly lower memory cost and approximately the same\nlatency: MAVE requires ~6x less memory than VoiceCraft during inference on\nutterances from the RealEdit database (mean duration: 6.21s, A100, FP16, batch\nsize 1). Our results demonstrate that MAVE establishes a new standard for\nflexible, high-fidelity voice editing and synthesis through the synergistic\nintegration of structured state-space modeling and cross-modal attention.",

Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a\npractical solution for the next generation of AI on a decentralized Web,\nenabling privacy-preserving collaborative fine-tuning by leveraging private\ndata distributed across a global client base. While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nis the standard for efficient fine-tuning, its application in federated\nsettings presents a critical challenge: communication overhead remains a\nsignificant bottleneck across the Web's heterogeneous network conditions. The\nstructural redundancy within LoRA parameters not only incurs a heavy\ncommunication burden but also introduces conflicts when aggregating client\nupdates.

The server then\nreconstructs and aggregates these updates in a full-rank space to mitigate\nconflicts. Finally, it decomposes the global update into a sparse low-rank\nformat for broadcast, ensuring a symmetrically efficient cycle.

In order to enhance the debiasing effectiveness during\nearly training stages, we further design a momentum update strategy that\nincrementally refines the aggregation weight matrix.

        "abstract": "The wording of natural language prompts has been shown to influence the\nperformance of large language models (LLMs), yet the role of politeness and\ntone remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying levels of\nprompt politeness affect model accuracy on multiple-choice questions. We\ncreated a dataset of 50 base questions spanning mathematics, science, and\nhistory, each rewritten into five tone variants: Very Polite, Polite, Neutral,\nRude, and Very Rude, yielding 250 unique prompts. Using ChatGPT 4o, we\nevaluated responses across these conditions and applied paired sample t-tests\nto assess statistical significance. Contrary to expectations, impolite prompts\nconsistently outperformed polite ones, with accuracy ranging from 80.8% for\nVery Polite prompts to 84.8% for Very Rude prompts. These findings differ from\nearlier studies that associated rudeness with poorer outcomes, suggesting that\nnewer LLMs may respond differently to tonal variation. Our results highlight\nthe importance of studying pragmatic aspects of prompting and raise broader\nquestions about the social dimensions of human-AI interaction.",

        "abstract": "Structured State-Space Duality (SSD) [Dao & Gu, ICML 2024] is an equivalence\nbetween a simple Structured State-Space Model (SSM) and a masked attention\nmechanism. In particular, a state-space model with a scalar-times-identity\nstate matrix is equivalent to a masked self-attention with a $1$-semiseparable\ncausal mask. Consequently, the same sequence transformation (model) has two\nalgorithmic realizations: as a linear-time $O(T)$ recurrence or as a\nquadratic-time $O(T^2)$ attention. In this note, we formalize and generalize\nthis duality: (i) we extend SSD from the scalar-identity case to general\ndiagonal SSMs (diagonal state matrices); (ii) we show that these diagonal SSMs\nmatch the scalar case's training complexity lower bounds while supporting\nricher dynamics; (iii) we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under\nwhich an SSM is equivalent to $1$-semiseparable masked attention; and (iv) we\nshow that such duality fails to extend to standard softmax attention due to\nrank explosion. Together, these results tighten bridge between recurrent SSMs\nand Transformers, and widen the design space for expressive yet efficient\nsequence models.",

However,\nreasoning distillation may inadvertently cause benchmark contamination, where\nevaluation data included in distillation datasets can inflate performance\nmetrics of distilled models. In this work, we formally define the task of\ndistillation data detection, which is uniquely challenging due to the partial\navailability of distillation data. Then, we propose a novel and effective\nmethod Token Probability Deviation (TBD), which leverages the probability\npatterns of the generated output tokens. Our method is motivated by the\nanalysis that distilled models tend to generate near-deterministic tokens for\nseen questions, while producing more low-probability tokens for unseen\nquestions. Our key idea behind TBD is to quantify how far the generated tokens'\nprobabilities deviate from a high reference probability. In effect, our method\nachieves competitive detection performance by producing lower scores for seen\nquestions than for unseen questions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method, achieving an AUC of 0.918 and a TPR@1% FPR of\n0.470 on the S1 dataset.",

However, existing defense strategies suffer from limited\ngeneralization: they only work on specific attack types or task settings. In\nthis study, we propose Poison-to-Poison (P2P), a general and effective backdoor\ndefense algorithm. P2P injects benign triggers with safe alternative labels\ninto a subset of training samples and fine-tunes the model on this re-poisoned\ndataset by leveraging prompt-based learning. This enforces the model to\nassociate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, thereby overriding\nthe effects of original malicious triggers. Thanks to this robust and\ngeneralizable trigger-based fine-tuning, P2P is effective across task settings\nand attack types. Theoretically and empirically, we show that P2P can\nneutralize malicious backdoors while preserving task performance. We conduct\nextensive experiments on classification, mathematical reasoning, and summary\ngeneration tasks, involving multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The results\ndemonstrate that our P2P algorithm significantly reduces the attack success\nrate compared with baseline models.

Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves\ndistinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal\ninformation (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple\naligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101\nresearch papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and\nspeaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta\nSimilarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos\nconvey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we\npropose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation\nvideo generation.

Although they do not achieve\nstate-of-the-art accuracy, they are more efficient and often excel at specific\ntasks. This raises a natural question: can multiple SLMs be orchestrated into a\nsystem where each contributes effectively, achieving higher accuracy than any\nindividual model? Existing orchestration methods have primarily targeted\nfrontier models (e.g., GPT-4) and perform suboptimally when applied to SLMs. To\naddress this gap, we propose a three-stage approach for orchestrating SLMs.\nFirst, we introduce SLM-MUX, a multi-model architecture that effectively\ncoordinates multiple SLMs. Building on this, we develop two optimization\nstrategies: (i) a model selection search that identifies the most complementary\nSLMs from a given pool, and (ii) test-time scaling tailored to SLM-MUX. Our\napproach delivers strong results: Compared to existing orchestration methods,\nour approach achieves up to 13.4% improvement on MATH, 8.8% on GPQA, and 7.0%\non GSM8K. With just two SLMS, SLM-MUX outperforms Qwen 2.5 72B on GPQA and\nGSM8K, and matches its performance on MATH. We further provide theoretical\nanalyses to substantiate the advantages of our method. In summary, we\ndemonstrate that SLMs can be effectively orchestrated into more accurate and\nefficient systems through the proposed approach.",

While initial studies have successfully\napplied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate\nunderstandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core\nreasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent.\nTo address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on\ntasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure\nrepresentation format.

Although it involves text analysis, the context and application are specific to the medical domain and do not align with the user's interests in e-commerce or real-time relevance optimization."
