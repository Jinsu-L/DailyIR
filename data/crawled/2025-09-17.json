        "abstract": "Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal\nrepresentations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer\nLLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and\noperates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually\nprovide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,\nor do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate\npopular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that\nthey succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,\nsuggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization\nmethods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations\noften reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated\nthem, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken\ntogether, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental\ncontrols to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful\ninsights into the operations of LLMs.",

Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined\nrelationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly\nexhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this\nchallenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite\nexploration through periodic context summarization.

For paradigm adaptation,\nwe propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and\nadvantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned\nreasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three\nbenchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of\n4.5\\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\\% following ReSum-GRPO\ntraining.

        "title": "Evaluating LLM Alignment on Personality Inference from Real-World Interview Data",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring\nnuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,\ncounselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret\nhuman personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains\nunexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While\nprior work has simulated LLM \"personas\" using discrete Big Five labels on\nsocial media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth\npersonality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely\nunexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising\nsemi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five\ntrait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance\nacross three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with\nGPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA\narchitectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT\nand OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson\ncorrelations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits\nremain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with\nvalidated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal\ngains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on\nlatent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings\nunderscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and\nmotivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and\nalignment-oriented fine-tuning.",

        "abstract": "The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems,\nespecially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new\nusers or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as\nconventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment\nwith shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation\nstrategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by\napplying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language\nModel (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained\ntoken-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to\nusing coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can\nbe used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate\nrecommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our\nmechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over\nbenchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings\nshow that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit\nRate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same\ncapability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more\ninterpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting.

Existing detection methods\nlargely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally\nconstrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,\nthat fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their\neffectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal\nAnalysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that\nmodels the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive\ngeneration.

A key challenge is the creation of agents\nthat can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon\nenvironments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to\ninteract with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,\nand (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to\nstimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable\nactions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate\nhigh-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning\nframework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon\nenvironments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill\nlibrary containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill\nplanner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized\nskills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a\nlong-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and\nchallenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting\noutperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully\ncrafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.\nAdditionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6\nclosed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately\nreleasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability.

Standard reinforcement learning\ntechniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on\nbrittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic\nessence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel\napproach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)\nframework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient\nencoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a\ndense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a\ngenerated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards\nexplanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and\nconceptually aligned with expert reasoning.

This work is the first systematic study\nof ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and\nlearning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally\nperforms worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,\nwith the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning\ndynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies\nfound in smaller models.

        "abstract": "The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the\nreproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of \"AI for Science\".\nHowever, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural\ncomponents and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address\nthis gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,\nstructured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case\nstudy in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric\napproach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to\nidentify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.\nSubsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow\nphrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of\n0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically\ncategorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages\nusing ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of\n0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the\ndocuments, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire\nresearch workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived\nfrom an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two\ndecades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition\nfrom feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated\ntechnical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,\nprocess-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving\nscientific paradigms.

        "abstract": "Origin-Destination (OD) matrices are a core component of research on users'\nmobility and summarize how individuals move between geographical regions. These\nregions should be small enough to be representative of user mobility, without\nincurring substantial privacy risks. There are two added values of the\nNetMob2025 challenge dataset. Firstly, the data is extensive and contains a lot\nof socio-demographic information that can be used to create multiple OD\nmatrices, based on the segments of the population. Secondly, a participant is\nnot merely a record in the data, but a statistically weighted proxy for a\nsegment of the real population. This opens the door to a fundamental shift in\nthe anonymization paradigm. A population-based view of privacy is central to\nour contribution. By adjusting our anonymization framework to account for\nrepresentativeness, we are also protecting the inferred identity of the actual\npopulation, rather than survey participants alone. The challenge addressed in\nthis work is to produce and compare OD matrices that are k-anonymous for survey\nparticipants and for the whole population. We compare several traditional\nmethods of anonymization to k-anonymity by generalizing geographical areas.\nThese include generalization over a hierarchy (ATG and OIGH) and the classical\nMondrian. To this established toolkit, we add a novel method, i.e., ODkAnon, a\ngreedy algorithm aiming at balancing speed and quality.

        "abstract": "Pre-ranking plays a crucial role in large-scale recommender systems by\nsignificantly improving the efficiency and scalability within the constraints\nof providing high-quality candidate sets in real time. The two-tower model is\nwidely used in pre-ranking systems due to a good balance between efficiency and\neffectiveness with decoupled architecture, which independently processes user\nand item inputs before calculating their interaction (e.g. dot product or\nsimilarity measure). However, this independence also leads to the lack of\ninformation interaction between the two towers, resulting in less\neffectiveness. In this paper, a novel architecture named learnable Fully\nInteracted Two-tower Model (FIT) is proposed, which enables rich information\ninteractions while ensuring inference efficiency. FIT mainly consists of two\nparts: Meta Query Module (MQM) and Lightweight Similarity Scorer (LSS).\nSpecifically, MQM introduces a learnable item meta matrix to achieve expressive\nearly interaction between user and item features. Moreover, LSS is designed to\nfurther obtain effective late interaction between the user and item towers.\nFinally, experimental results on several public datasets show that our proposed\nFIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline pre-ranking models.",

In this paper, we\nintroduce \\textit{Content Concretization} (CC), a novel jailbreaking technique\nthat iteratively transforms abstract malicious requests into concrete,\nexecutable implementations.

We evaluate our technique using 350\ncybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in\njailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\\% (no refinements) to 62\\%\nafter three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\\textcent~per\nprompt.

Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing\nLLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding\nmodels. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM\ntrained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data\nand multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on\nthis, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to\nbetter integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs\nuse a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional\nmask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less\neffective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually\ntransition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more\ncomprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard\nnegative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative\nexamples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with\nonly approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA\nperformance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese\nMTEB (May 19, 2025).",

Our main\ncontribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image\ncontrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which\nmeasures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our\ntraining methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept\nabstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed\nto the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training\nforces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic\nrepresentation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the\nhigher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that\nthis training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in\nabstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to\naddress key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination,\noutdated knowledge, and lacking reference. However, current RAG frameworks\noften struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully\ncontribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter\nout irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final\nperformance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel\nmetric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct\nanswer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference\nof LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.\nFurther, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to\ntrain a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from\nexact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can\neffectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones\nfor better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing\napproaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on\nNaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match\naccuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG\nrespectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary\nmodel GPT-4o across all datasets.

This work proposes an efficient,\neffective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway\nanalysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus\nrecommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel\ncombination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,\nmutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.\nThen, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by\nmutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nthat predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN\npredictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple\ndrug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible\ntreatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater\nthan 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing\nplayed an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating\nthat each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key\ndriver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted\ngene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.\nOverall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective\nend-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible\ntreatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.",

Conventional content moderation classifiers,\nwhich are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from\nmisclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data\nand adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence\ntactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial\ntraining or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim\nto identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute\nto misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic\ninterpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa\nclassifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.\nWe use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.\nFinally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against\nadversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these\nvulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.\nWe find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance\nor vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves\nperformance on adversarial input.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated\nTheorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely\nadopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce\nsignificant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost\nanalyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while\nneglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by\ndifferent scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the\nefficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and\ndemonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source\napproaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage\nand sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we\npropose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL\npipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching\nmechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse\nparallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance\npass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and\nProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to\nbaseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides\nactionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing\nperformance.",

        "abstract": "We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning\nframework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown\nimpressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment\non resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy\nattention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA\naddresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual\ntokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and\nadopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through\nfine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens\nwhile pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby\nimproving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires\nno heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,\nmaking it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token\npruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher\nsuccess rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,\nLightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%\nimprovement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable\nquery-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable\nparameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that\nas VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune\ntokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge,\nLightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks\nwith the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant\nstep toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.",

Despite theoretical attention, there remains\nlimited empirical work that systematically traces how specific ideas evolve,\nare prioritized, or are discarded during deliberation to form policy\nrecommendations. Addressing these gaps, this work poses two central questions:\n(1) How might we trace the evolution and distillation of ideas into concrete\nrecommendations within deliberative assemblies? (2) How does the deliberative\nprocess shape delegate perspectives and influence voting dynamics over the\ncourse of the assembly? To address these questions, we develop LLM-based\nmethodologies for empirically analyzing transcripts from a tech-enhanced\nin-person deliberative assembly. The framework identifies and visualizes the\nspace of expressed suggestions. We also empirically reconstruct each delegate's\nevolving perspective throughout the assembly.

Comparing with related methods, the\nproposed method entangles the watermark with the intrinsic parameters of the\nLLM, which better balances the robustness and imperceptibility of the\nwatermark.

        "abstract": "Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct\nhuman supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with\nreasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can\nbe systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose\nReason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into\nsupervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates\ninitial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific\ninputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,\nto form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to\ncalibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual\npreferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a\ncase study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams\n(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where\nprompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600\nEERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes\nspanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a\npractical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce\ndomains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.",
