        "title": "Effective Training Data Synthesis for Improving MLLM Chart Understanding",
        "abstract": "Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a\ncentral part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are\nstill falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging\nbenchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are\noften restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could\ncompromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this\nstudy, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual\ndetails improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a\nfive-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation\nfor single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on\nearlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated\nfigures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer\n(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of\nfine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which\ncontains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring\n250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD\nconsistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world\nand synthetic test sets.

        "abstract": "Humans communicate with increasing efficiency in multi-turn interactions, by\nadapting their language and forming ad-hoc conventions. In contrast, prior work\nshows that LLMs do not naturally show this behavior. We develop a post-training\nprocess to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically\nidentified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new\nbenchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused,\ncognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong\nconvention formation trends in humans.

        "abstract": "Haptic captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions\nfrom haptic signals, such as vibrations, for use in virtual reality,\naccessibility, and rehabilitation applications. While previous multimodal\nresearch has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the\nsense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the\nhaptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language\nmodel that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,\nemotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic\ntokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that\nconvert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their\nintegration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)\nsupervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,\nand (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We\nassess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics\nand human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in\ninterpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a\nBLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated\ncaptions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF\nyielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating\nstronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the\npotential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data.",

We show that current LLM safety\nguardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective\nagainst such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level\nsafeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered\nincrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the\ntransformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern\ntext-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline.

A number of following\npublications have shown that the effectiveness of these models can be improved\nby, for example, slightly updating the architecture of the Transformer layers,\nusing better training objectives, and employing improved loss functions.\nHowever, the additivity of these modular improvements has not been\nsystematically benchmarked - this is the gap we aim to close in this paper.\nThrough our experiments, we identify a very strong model that uses SASRec's\ntraining objective, LiGR Transformer layers, and Sampled Softmax Loss. We call\nthis combination eSASRec (Enhanced SASRec). While we primarily focus on\nrealistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that\ncommon academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to\nthe most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece. In our main\nproduction-like benchmark, eSASRec resides on the Pareto frontier in terms of\nthe accuracy-coverage tradeoff (alongside the recent industrial models HSTU and\nFuXi. As the modifications compared to the original SASRec are relatively\nstraightforward and no extra features are needed (such as timestamps in HSTU),\nwe believe that eSASRec can be easily integrated into existing recommendation\npipelines and can can serve as a strong yet very simple baseline for emerging\ncomplicated algorithms.

        "abstract": "Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by\nhigh computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention\ncomputation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,\nlimiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative\nframework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical\nprompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information\ndiffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through\nlayers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion\nprocess suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive\ntokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.\nMotivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning\nmechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at\nintermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous\nKV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex\npredictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments\nshow that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\\mathbf{2.53\\times}$ time-to-first-token\n(TTFT) speedup and $\\mathbf{1.88\\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on\nLongBench.

Sentence-level\nanalysis reveals LLMs are often used in the introduction of news, while\nconclusions usually written manually. Linguistic analysis shows GenAI boosts\nword richness and readability but lowers formality, leading to more uniform\nwriting styles, particularly in local media.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by\nenabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of\nwhether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer\nto unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we\nfine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or\nmultilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter\nacross 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific\ndiscourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables\ncross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects\npre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages\ncan reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,\nidentifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance\nbenefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant\nlanguages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during\nfine-tuning (as little as $9.62\\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training\ntoken volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption\nthat cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited\nlanguage coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural\nbiases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing\n4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source,\nreproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster\ninference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model,\nenabling scalable, inclusive research.",

However, its non-isolated execution context introduces\ncritical security and privacy risks. In particular, adversarially crafted\ncontent can induce tool poisoning or indirect prompt injection, leading to\nconversation hijacking, misinformation propagation, or data exfiltration.\nExisting defenses, such as rule-based filters or LLM-driven detection, remain\ninadequate due to their reliance on static signatures, computational\ninefficiency, and inability to quantify conversational hijacking. To address\nthese limitations, we propose SecMCP, a secure framework that detects and\nquantifies conversation drift, deviations in latent space trajectories induced\nby adversarial external knowledge. By modeling LLM activation vectors within a\nlatent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous shifts in conversational\ndynamics, enabling proactive detection of hijacking, misleading, and data\nexfiltration.

However,\nthese methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility\nto primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy\nquality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful\nplugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based\noptimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay\nnumber, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the\nrisk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a\nperiodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network\nplasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective,\ncombining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further\nbolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR\nsignificantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods\non both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative\nDPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging\nmath tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based\nalgorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical,\nsample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking\ngreater performance from limited data.",

However, there remains a significant research gap in combining\nthese capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual\ncharacters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a\ncase study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.\nThis choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide\nemotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce\nChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We\nfirst thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities\nand design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a\nnationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with\nprofound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in\nrole-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from\n10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP\nperformance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system\nfeaturing 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,\nrole-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response\ndiversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000\nLLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.\nExperimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in\nrole-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response\ndiversity.

We manually collected 494\ninfographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate\n1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then\ncarefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on\nsurface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our\nexperimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in\ncomputational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal\nreasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a\nsubstantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal\ninference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal\nreasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.",

We present classification\nusing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional\nclassification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with\npre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual\nknowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the\ntask from \"is this hate speech?\" to \"does this violate the hate speech policy?\"\n  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates\nthis approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification\naccuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability\nvia retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model\nretraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline\nperformance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by\ncorrectly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring\nretraining or compromising overall performance.

While continuing pre-training on large\ncorpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven\nsuccessful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains\nchallenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,\nunstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic\nforgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap\nwith the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by\nprobing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.\nStarting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different\naugmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge\nacquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing\npre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the\nmodel to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new\nfacts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through\ndiverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in\nsmall-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new\ncontent and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of\nRAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater\ndegradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data\nthemselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates.

With the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further\nrefined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the\ntraditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures\ndestabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine\nCommunication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second\nsection examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the\nmachine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics\ncontinue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to\npredictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the\nRational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing\non optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the\nissue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and\ncommunicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM\nevaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the\npaper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of\nincreased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,\nemphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both\nfor the model and themselves.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal\ntrade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful\nones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with\ndenser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,\nmore critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and\nmultimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and\nsignificantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading\nmerging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\\% across 8\nViT-B/32 tasks.

        "title": "Less is More: Selective Reflection for Compatible and Efficient Knowledge Distillation in Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large\nlanguage models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However,\nexisting white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and\nstudent-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training\ndata quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we\npropose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation\nframework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically\nrefine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response\npairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively\ncurating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated\nranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a\ncurriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these\ncurated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a\nplug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes\nacross diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as\ndecreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a\nrange of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in\ndistilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up\nto 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a\nplug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying\nKD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are\npivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a\nprincipled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of\ndata-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the\ncapability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.",

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by\nretrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM\nreasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the\nrelational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable\nperformance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)\nmethods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,\nintroducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world\nqueries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for\naccurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required\nstructures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we\npropose a \\textbf{\\underline{Logic}}-aware\n\\textbf{\\underline{R}}etrieval-\\textbf{\\underline{A}}ugmented\n\\textbf{\\underline{G}}eneration framework (\\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically\nextracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval\nwithout any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query\ninto a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to\nmodel the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step\nreasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that\nsubproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG\napplies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to\nfilter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior\nperformance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "title": "Efficient Multimodal Streaming Recommendation via Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts",
        "abstract": "Streaming recommender systems (SRSs) are widely deployed in real-world\napplications, where user interests shift and new items arrive over time. As a\nresult, effectively capturing users' latest preferences is challenging, as\ninteractions reflecting recent interests are limited and new items often lack\nsufficient feedback. A common solution is to enrich item representations using\nmultimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features.\nHowever, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not\ntailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user\ntastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual\ntones can also drift over time. This presents two key challenges in streaming\nscenarios: the high cost of fine-tuning large multimodal encoders, and the risk\nof forgetting long-term user preferences due to continuous model updates.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts\n(XSMoE), a memory-efficient framework for multimodal streaming recommendation.\nXSMoE attaches lightweight side-tuning modules consisting of expandable expert\nnetworks to frozen pretrained encoders and incrementally expands them in\nresponse to evolving user feedback. A gating router dynamically combines expert\nand backbone outputs, while a utilization-based pruning strategy maintains\nmodel compactness. By learning new patterns through expandable experts without\noverwriting previously acquired knowledge, XSMoE effectively captures both cold\nstart and shifting preferences in multimodal features. Experiments on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that XSMoE outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines in both recommendation quality and computational efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Cross-topic automated essay scoring (AES) aims to develop a transferable\nmodel capable of effectively evaluating essays on a target topic. A significant\nchallenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.\nWhile existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features\nthrough distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect\ntopic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such\nas topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial\nTOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns\ntopic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP\nachieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both\nshared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt\nlearning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,\nwe incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and\nclassification framework. In addition, we employ a neighbor-based classifier to\nmodel the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels\nfor target-topic essays. These pseudo-labels are then used to guide the\nsupervised learning of topic-specific prompts tailored to the target topic.\nExtensive experiments on the publicly available ASAP++ dataset demonstrate that\nATOP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both\nholistic and multi-trait essay scoring.

We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that\nenables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while\nminimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the\nbest LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled\nexamples.

This study\ninvestigates the link between ethical AI and user satisfaction by analyzing\nover 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2. Using transformer-based\nlanguage models, we measure sentiment across seven ethical dimensions defined\nby the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. Our findings show that all\nseven dimensions are positively associated with user satisfaction. Yet, this\nrelationship varies systematically across user and product types. Technical\nusers and reviewers of AI development platforms more frequently discuss\nsystem-level concerns (e.g., transparency, data governance), while\nnon-technical users and reviewers of end-user applications emphasize\nhuman-centric dimensions (e.g., human agency, societal well-being). Moreover,\nthe association between ethical AI and user satisfaction is significantly\nstronger for non-technical users and end-user applications across all\ndimensions.

Interestingly,\nfollow up analyses revealed that this discrepancy - better language modeling,\nyet worse reading time prediction - could not be accounted for by prior\nexplanations of why better language models sometimes fit human reading time\nworse. Together, these results support a benefit of memory limitations on\nneural network language learning - but not on predicting behavior.",

        "abstract": "This dialog paper offers a preview and provides a foretaste of an upcoming\nwork on the axiomatization of basic interactive algorithms.\n  The modern notion of algorithm was elucidated in the 1930s--1950s. It was\naxiomatized a quarter of a century ago as the notion of ``sequential\nalgorithm'' or ``classical algorithm''; we prefer to call it ``basic algorithm\"\nnow. The axiomatization was used to show that for every basic algorithm there\nis a behaviorally equivalent abstract state machine. It was also used to prove\nthe Church-Turing thesis as it has been understood by the logicians.\n  Starting from the 1960s, the notion of algorithm has expanded --\nprobabilistic algorithms, quantum algorithms, etc. -- prompting introduction of\na much more ambitious version of the Church-Turing thesis commonly known as the\n``physical thesis.'' We emphasize the difference between the two versions of\nthe Church-Turing thesis and illustrate how nondeterministic and probabilistic\nalgorithms can be viewed as basic algorithms with appropriate oracles. The same\nview applies to quantum circuit algorithms and many other classes of\nalgorithms.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce hallucinations - factually\nincorrect or fabricated information - which poses significant challenges for\nmany Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as dialogue systems.\nAs a result, detecting hallucinations has become a critical area of research.\nCurrent approaches to hallucination detection in dialogue systems primarily\nfocus on verifying the factual consistency of generated responses. However,\nthese responses often contain a mix of accurate, inaccurate or unverifiable\nfacts, making one factual label overly simplistic and coarse-grained. In this\npaper, we introduce a benchmark, FineDialFact, for fine-grained dialogue fact\nverification, which involves verifying atomic facts extracted from dialogue\nresponses. To support this, we construct a dataset based on publicly available\ndialogue datasets and evaluate it using various baseline methods. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that methods incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning\ncan enhance performance in dialogue fact verification. Despite this, the best\nF1-score achieved on the HybriDialogue, an open-domain dialogue dataset, is\nonly 0.75, indicating that the benchmark remains a challenging task for future\nresearch. Our dataset and code will be public on GitHub.",

These models enable beneficial applications such\nas content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code\nreasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or\nintentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of\nLLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential\nsources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In\nthis survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional\ntoxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques.\nWe propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze\nemerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess\nmitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback\n(RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the\nevolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation\nmethodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development\nof robust and ethically aligned language technologies.",

        "abstract": "Web agents such as Deep Research have demonstrated superhuman cognitive\nabilities, capable of solving highly challenging information-seeking problems.\nHowever, most research remains primarily text-centric, overlooking visual\ninformation in the real world. This makes multimodal Deep Research highly\nchallenging, as such agents require much stronger reasoning abilities in\nperception, logic, knowledge, and the use of more sophisticated tools compared\nto text-based agents. To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a\nmulti-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language\nreasoning capabilities. It leverages high-quality synthetic multimodal\ntrajectories for efficient cold start training, utilizes various tools for deep\nreasoning, and further enhances generalization through reinforcement learning.\nTo better evaluate the capabilities of multimodal agents, we propose\nBrowseComp-VL, a benchmark with BrowseComp-style that requires complex\ninformation retrieval involving both visual and textual information.\nExperimental results show that WebWatcher significantly outperforms proprietary\nbaseline, RAG workflow and open-source agents in four challenging VQA\nbenchmarks, which paves the way for solving complex multimodal\ninformation-seeking tasks.",
