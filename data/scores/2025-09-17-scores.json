        "title": "InfoGain-RAG: Boosting Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Document Information Gain-based Reranking and Filtering",
        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to\naddress key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination,\noutdated knowledge, and lacking reference. However, current RAG frameworks\noften struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully\ncontribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter\nout irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final\nperformance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel\nmetric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct\nanswer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference\nof LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.\nFurther, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to\ntrain a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from\nexact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can\neffectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones\nfor better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing\napproaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on\nNaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match\naccuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG\nrespectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary\nmodel GPT-4o across all datasets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of\nInfoGain-RAG as it can offer a reliable solution for RAG in multiple\napplications.",

        "abstract": "We present LEAF (\"Lightweight Embedding Alignment Framework\"), a knowledge\ndistillation framework for text embedding models. A key distinguishing feature\nis that our distilled leaf models are aligned to their teacher. In the context\nof information retrieval, this allows for flexible asymmetric architectures\nwhere documents are encoded with the larger teacher model, while queries can be\nserved with the smaller leaf models. We also show that leaf models\nautomatically inherit MRL and robustness to output quantization whenever these\nproperties are present in the teacher model, without explicitly training for\nthem. To demonstrate the capability of our framework we publish leaf-ir, a 23M\nparameters information retrieval oriented text embedding model trained using\nLEAF, which sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on BEIR, ranking #1 on the\npublic leaderboard for this benchmark and for models of its size. When run in\nasymmetric mode, its retrieval performance is further increased. Our scheme is\nhowever not restricted to the information retrieval setting, and we demonstrate\nits wider applicability by synthesizing the multi-task leaf-mt model. This also\nsets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its\nsize. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding\nmodel training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives,\nand training can be conducted using small batch sizes. Thus, dataset and\ntraining infrastructure requirements for our framework are modest. We make our\nmodels publicly available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.",

        "abstract": "Pre-ranking plays a crucial role in large-scale recommender systems by\nsignificantly improving the efficiency and scalability within the constraints\nof providing high-quality candidate sets in real time. The two-tower model is\nwidely used in pre-ranking systems due to a good balance between efficiency and\neffectiveness with decoupled architecture, which independently processes user\nand item inputs before calculating their interaction (e.g. dot product or\nsimilarity measure). However, this independence also leads to the lack of\ninformation interaction between the two towers, resulting in less\neffectiveness. In this paper, a novel architecture named learnable Fully\nInteracted Two-tower Model (FIT) is proposed, which enables rich information\ninteractions while ensuring inference efficiency. FIT mainly consists of two\nparts: Meta Query Module (MQM) and Lightweight Similarity Scorer (LSS).\nSpecifically, MQM introduces a learnable item meta matrix to achieve expressive\nearly interaction between user and item features. Moreover, LSS is designed to\nfurther obtain effective late interaction between the user and item towers.\nFinally, experimental results on several public datasets show that our proposed\nFIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline pre-ranking models.",

While VLA models have shown\nimpressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment\non resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy\nattention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA\naddresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual\ntokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and\nadopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through\nfine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens\nwhile pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby\nimproving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires\nno heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,\nmaking it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token\npruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher\nsuccess rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,\nLightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%\nimprovement in task success rate.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the\ndevelopment of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents\nthat can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon\nenvironments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to\ninteract with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,\nand (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to\nstimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable\nactions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate\nhigh-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning\nframework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon\nenvironments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill\nlibrary containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill\nplanner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized\nskills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a\nlong-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and\nchallenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting\noutperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully\ncrafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.\nAdditionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6\nclosed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately\nreleasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our\ncode is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.",

This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled\napproach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal\ncontexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.\n  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which\ninter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and\nhuman assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons\nbetween competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that\ntraditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in\nthe skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations.

        "abstract": "Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models\n(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods\nlargely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally\nconstrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,\nthat fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their\neffectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal\nAnalysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that\nmodels the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive\ngeneration. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across\nlayers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain\nrepresentations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as\nspectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of\nLLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable\ndetection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over\n10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By\nintegrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD\nestablishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.",

Existing \"top-down\"\nmethods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve\nevidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the\navailable knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel \"bottom-up,\" data-driven\nframework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is\npredicated on a \"Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure\"\nstrategy, which first establishes the \"knowledge boundaries\" of the source\ncorpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform\nexhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an\nunsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into\ndistinct \"knowledge clusters.\" These clusters form an objective, data-driven\nfoundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical\noutline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the\ngenerated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source\nmaterial, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and\nfundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on\nboth 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves\nperformance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is\nexpected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios\nthat demand high fidelity and structural coherence.

        "abstract": "Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks\nlike event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,\ntimeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language\ninference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets\nare limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary\nevents. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual\ndatabase of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and\narticle infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both\nhistorical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we\nconstruct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning\nacross all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA\nreasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models\n(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their\nperformance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer\ntypes and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our\nwork aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and\ntemporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To\nfacilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly\navailable upon acceptance of this paper.",

        "abstract": "In an era of increasing societal fragmentation, political polarization, and\nerosion of public trust in institutions, representative deliberative assemblies\nare emerging as a promising democratic forum for developing effective policy\noutcomes on complex global issues. Despite theoretical attention, there remains\nlimited empirical work that systematically traces how specific ideas evolve,\nare prioritized, or are discarded during deliberation to form policy\nrecommendations. Addressing these gaps, this work poses two central questions:\n(1) How might we trace the evolution and distillation of ideas into concrete\nrecommendations within deliberative assemblies? (2) How does the deliberative\nprocess shape delegate perspectives and influence voting dynamics over the\ncourse of the assembly? To address these questions, we develop LLM-based\nmethodologies for empirically analyzing transcripts from a tech-enhanced\nin-person deliberative assembly. The framework identifies and visualizes the\nspace of expressed suggestions. We also empirically reconstruct each delegate's\nevolving perspective throughout the assembly. Our methods contribute novel\nempirical insights into deliberative processes and demonstrate how LLMs can\nsurface high-resolution dynamics otherwise invisible in traditional assembly\noutputs.",

In this\npaper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for\ntemporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)\narchitecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy\nin videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our\narchitecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure\ntemporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction\nmodule that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally\nredundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.\nSecond, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the\nframe-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our\napproach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully\nsupervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost\n(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while\nclosely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.",

By gradually increasing the\nnumber of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their\noptimal quantity for each LLM.

In this paper, we present\nthe first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2\nand the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,\nimage-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting\nand fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable\ninsights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but\nstruggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA\nsubstantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy\nwhen combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal\nsettings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent\nchallenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal\ngrounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Deep hashing models have been widely adopted to tackle the challenges of\nlarge-scale image retrieval. However, these approaches face serious security\nrisks due to their vulnerability to adversarial examples. Despite the\nincreasing exploration of targeted attacks on deep hashing models, existing\napproaches still suffer from a lack of multimodal guidance, reliance on\nlabeling information and dependence on pixel-level operations for attacks. To\naddress these limitations, we proposed DiffHash, a novel diffusion-based\ntargeted attack for deep hashing. Unlike traditional pixel-based attacks that\ndirectly modify specific pixels and lack multimodal guidance, our approach\nfocuses on optimizing the latent representations of images, guided by text\ninformation generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) for the target image.\nFurthermore, we designed a multi-space hash alignment network to align the\nhigh-dimension image space and text space to the low-dimension binary hash\nspace. During reconstruction, we also incorporated text-guided attention\nmechanisms to refine adversarial examples, ensuring them aligned with the\ntarget semantics while maintaining visual plausibility. Extensive experiments\nhave demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) targeted\nattack methods, achieving better black-box transferability and offering more\nexcellent stability across datasets.",

        "abstract": "Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading\ncause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging\nfield, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet\nlab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,\neffective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway\nanalysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus\nrecommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel\ncombination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,\nmutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.\nThen, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by\nmutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nthat predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN\npredictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple\ndrug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible\ntreatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater\nthan 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing\nplayed an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating\nthat each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key\ndriver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted\ngene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.\nOverall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective\nend-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible\ntreatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.",

        "abstract": "While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area\nof research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This\nmotivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions\nand understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a\nsimple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific\nrepresentations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise\ninterventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while\npreserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related\nquestions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show\nthat the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust\ntarget representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a\nsingle A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be\nperformed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented\ndata-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal\nvectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can\ncounteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control\nof model behavior.",

While\nresearch on collective action discourse has primarily focused on text-based\ncontent, this study takes a first step toward analyzing audio formats by using\npodcast transcripts. Using the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC), we\ninvestigated spoken language expressions of participation in collective action,\ncategorized as problem-solution, call-to-action, intention, and execution. We\nidentified podcast episodes discussing racial justice after important\nBLM-related events in May and June of 2020, and extracted participatory\nstatements using a layered framework adapted from prior work on social media.\nWe examined the emotional dimensions of these statements, detecting eight key\nemotions and their association with varying stages of activism. We found that\nemotional profiles vary by stage, with different positive emotions standing out\nduring calls-to-action, intention, and execution. We detected negative\nassociations between collective action and negative emotions, contrary to\ntheoretical expectations. Our work contributes to a better understanding of how\nactivism is expressed in spoken digital discourse and how emotional framing may\ndepend on the format of the discussion.",

        "abstract": "The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems,\nespecially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new\nusers or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as\nconventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment\nwith shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation\nstrategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by\napplying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language\nModel (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained\ntoken-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to\nusing coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can\nbe used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate\nrecommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our\nmechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over\nbenchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings\nshow that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit\nRate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same\ncapability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more\ninterpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The\npractical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight,\nbut nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the\nzero-shot setting is indicated within this work.",

        "abstract": "Origin-Destination (OD) matrices are a core component of research on users'\nmobility and summarize how individuals move between geographical regions. These\nregions should be small enough to be representative of user mobility, without\nincurring substantial privacy risks. There are two added values of the\nNetMob2025 challenge dataset. Firstly, the data is extensive and contains a lot\nof socio-demographic information that can be used to create multiple OD\nmatrices, based on the segments of the population. Secondly, a participant is\nnot merely a record in the data, but a statistically weighted proxy for a\nsegment of the real population. This opens the door to a fundamental shift in\nthe anonymization paradigm. A population-based view of privacy is central to\nour contribution. By adjusting our anonymization framework to account for\nrepresentativeness, we are also protecting the inferred identity of the actual\npopulation, rather than survey participants alone. The challenge addressed in\nthis work is to produce and compare OD matrices that are k-anonymous for survey\nparticipants and for the whole population. We compare several traditional\nmethods of anonymization to k-anonymity by generalizing geographical areas.\nThese include generalization over a hierarchy (ATG and OIGH) and the classical\nMondrian. To this established toolkit, we add a novel method, i.e., ODkAnon, a\ngreedy algorithm aiming at balancing speed and quality. Unlike previous\napproaches, which primarily address the privacy aspects of the given datasets,\nwe aim to contribute to the generation of privacy-preserving OD matrices\nenriched with socio-demographic segmentation that achieves k-anonymity on the\nactual population.",

Traditional watermarking\nmethods based on training or fine-tuning may be extendable to LLMs. However,\nmost of them are limited to the white-box scenario, or very time-consuming due\nto the massive parameters of LLMs. In this paper, we present a new watermarking\nframework for LLMs, where the watermark is embedded into the LLM by\nmanipulating the internal parameters of the LLM, and can be extracted from the\ngenerated text without accessing the LLM. Comparing with related methods, the\nproposed method entangles the watermark with the intrinsic parameters of the\nLLM, which better balances the robustness and imperceptibility of the\nwatermark. Moreover, the proposed method enables us to extract the watermark\nunder the black-box scenario, which is computationally efficient for use.\nExperimental results have also verified the feasibility, superiority and\npracticality.

        "abstract": "Generative paradigm, especially powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has\nemerged as a new solution to the next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation.\nPioneering studies usually adopt a two-stage pipeline, starting with a\ntokenizer converting POIs into discrete identifiers that can be processed by\nLLMs, followed by POI behavior prediction tasks to instruction-tune LLM for\nnext POI recommendation. Despite of remarkable progress, they still face two\nlimitations: (1) existing tokenizers struggle to encode heterogeneous signals\nin the recommendation data, suffering from information loss issue, and (2)\nprevious instruction-tuning tasks only focus on users' POI visit behavior while\nignore other behavior types, resulting in insufficient understanding of\nmobility. To address these limitations, we propose KGTB (Knowledge Graph\nTokenization for Behavior-aware generative next POI recommendation).\nSpecifically, KGTB organizes the recommendation data in a knowledge graph (KG)\nformat, of which the structure can seamlessly preserve the heterogeneous\ninformation. Then, a KG-based tokenizer is developed to quantize each node into\nan individual structural ID. This process is supervised by the KG's structure,\nthus reducing the loss of heterogeneous information. Using generated IDs, KGTB\nproposes multi-behavior learning that introduces multiple behavior-specific\nprediction tasks for LLM fine-tuning, e.g., POI, category, and region visit\nbehaviors. Learning on these behavior tasks provides LLMs with comprehensive\ninsights on the target POI visit behavior.
