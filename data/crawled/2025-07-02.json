Unlike traditional benchmarks\nfor scientific literature understanding and synthesis, SciArena engages the\nresearch community directly, following the Chatbot Arena evaluation approach of\ncommunity voting on model comparisons. By leveraging collective intelligence,\nSciArena offers a community-driven evaluation of model performance on\nopen-ended scientific tasks that demand literature-grounded, long-form\nresponses. The platform currently supports 23 open-source and proprietary\nfoundation models and has collected over 13,000 votes from trusted researchers\nacross diverse scientific domains. We analyze the data collected so far and\nconfirm that the submitted questions are diverse, aligned with real-world\nliterature needs, and that participating researchers demonstrate strong\nself-consistency and inter-annotator agreement in their evaluations. We discuss\nthe results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further\npromote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for\nliterature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based\non our collected preference data. The benchmark measures the accuracy of models\nin judging answer quality by comparing their pairwise assessments with human\nvotes. Our experiments highlight the benchmark's challenges and emphasize the\nneed for more reliable automated evaluation methods.",

        "title": "Should We Still Pretrain Encoders with Masked Language Modeling?",
        "abstract": "Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of\nNLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked\nLanguage Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models\npretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as\nencoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation\nbenchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent\nadvantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model\nand data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of\nlarge-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30\nmodels ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over\n15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM\ngenerally yields better performance across text representation tasks,\nCLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning\nstability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic\ntraining strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal\nperformance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from\nreadily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),\nreducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.\nWe release all project artifacts at https://hf.co/MLMvsCLM to foster further\nresearch.",

        "abstract": "Moral self-correction has emerged as a promising approach for aligning the\noutput of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human moral values. However, moral\nself-correction techniques are subject to two primary paradoxes. First, despite\nempirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of\nself-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.\nSecond, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of\ntheir output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency\nduring their self-correction process. To better understand and address these\nparadoxes, we analyze the discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora\ndesigned to enhance moral self-correction, uncovering the existence of the\nheuristics underlying effective constructions. We demonstrate that moral\nself-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic\nshortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during\nself-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both\nself-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly. Based on our findings,\nwe propose a solution to improve moral self-correction by leveraging the\nheuristics of curated datasets. We also highlight the generalization challenges\nof this capability, particularly in terms of learning from situated context and\nmodel scales.",

Existing work has explored contrastive\ndecoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original\nLVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However,\nthese methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response\ngeneration, making them less suitable for real-time applications.

Stylometry has been\nused extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.\nBy applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing\npatterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,\nwith (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs\n(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text\nsummarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods\n(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models\n(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and\nn-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,\ngrammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results\nreached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the\nmulticlass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary\nclassification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up\nto .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed\nfeatures characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused\nwords, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to\nhuman-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the\nincreasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine-\nfrom human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.",

        "abstract": "Moral judgment is integral to large language model (LLM) alignment and social\nreasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to\nunderstand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to\nindividual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a\nutilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits\nfor the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar\ndynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on\nwell-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where\nmodels reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn\ndiscussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must\ndecide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all\nmodels found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than\nindividually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that\nmaximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar\nindividuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.\nHowever, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their\nutilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from\nheightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced\nnorm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface\nbehavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying\ndrivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent\ndesign, and artificial moral reasoning.",

To address\nthis issue, we propose a TTS method with multi-step interaction that allows\nusers to intuitively and rapidly refine synthesized speech.

First, we provide an\nintroduction on GenAI's generative and probabilistic nature as rooted in\ndistributional linguistics.

Second, we leverage this\ndistinction for a critical engagement with recent experiments using GenAI in\nscientometrics, including topic labelling, the analysis of citation contexts,\npredictive applications, scholars' profiling, and research assessment. GenAI\nshows promise in tasks where language generation dominates, such as labelling,\nbut faces limitations in tasks that require stable semantics, pragmatic\nreasoning, or structured domain knowledge. However, these results might become\nquickly outdated. Our recommendation is, therefore, to always strive to\nsystematically compare the performance of different GenAI models for specific\ntasks. Third, we inquire whether, by generating large amounts of scientific\nlanguage, GenAI might have a fundamental impact on our field by affecting\ntextual characteristics used to measure science, such as authors, words, and\nreferences. We argue that careful empirical work and theoretical reflection\nwill be essential to remain capable of interpreting the evolving patterns of\nknowledge production.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of\nlarge language models in low-resource language scenarios. It proposes a unified\nframework that combines a knowledge transfer module with parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning strategies. The method introduces knowledge alignment loss and soft\nprompt tuning to guide the model in effectively absorbing the structural\nfeatures of target languages or tasks under minimal annotation. This enhances\nboth generalization performance and training stability. The framework includes\nlightweight adaptation modules to reduce computational costs. During training,\nit integrates freezing strategies and prompt injection to preserve the model's\noriginal knowledge while enabling quick adaptation to new tasks. The study also\nconducts stability analysis experiments and synthetic pseudo-data transfer\nexperiments to systematically evaluate the method's applicability and\nrobustness across different low-resource tasks. Experimental results show that\ncompared with existing multilingual pre-trained models and mainstream transfer\nmethods, the proposed approach achieves higher performance and stability on\ncross-lingual tasks such as MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X. It demonstrates\nparticularly strong advantages under extremely data-scarce conditions. The\nproposed method offers strong generality and scalability. It enhances\ntask-specific adaptability while preserving the general capabilities of large\nlanguage models.

The method represents semantic\nfeatures in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a\ndynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule\nlayers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures\nbetween semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional\nfeature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial\nsemantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through\nan iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based\nmechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's\nability to distinguish between intent classes. Experiments are conducted using\na public natural language understanding dataset. Multiple mainstream models are\nused for comparison. Results show that the proposed model outperforms\ntraditional methods and other deep learning structures in terms of accuracy,\nF1-score, and intent detection rate.

This paper proposes an\nend-to-end transformer-based model for beat and downbeat tracking in\nperformance MIDI, leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture for\nsequence-to-sequence translation of MIDI input to beat annotations. Our\napproach introduces novel data preprocessing techniques, including dynamic\naugmentation and optimized tokenization strategies, to improve accuracy and\ngeneralizability across different datasets. We conduct extensive experiments\nusing the A-MAPS, ASAP, GuitarSet, and Leduc datasets, comparing our model\nagainst state-of-the-art hidden Markov models (HMMs) and deep learning-based\nbeat tracking methods. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms\nexisting symbolic music beat tracking approaches, achieving competitive\nF1-scores across various musical styles and instruments.

But as math leaderboards improve week by week,\nit is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or\njust narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20\nopen-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including\nmath, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard\ninstruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in\nmath fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this\nphenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using\nmath-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space\nrepresentation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT\ninduces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves\ngeneral-domain structure.

ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through\na synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over\nmathematical problem-solving trajectories.

We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve\nperformance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3\nfamily of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500,\n26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon\nchallenging problems that require iterative correction.

However, multi-hop\nquestions, such as \"Which company among NVIDIA, Apple, and Google made the\nbiggest profit in 2023?,\" challenge RAG because relevant facts are often\ndistributed across multiple documents rather than co-occurring in one source,\nmaking it difficult for standard RAG to retrieve sufficient information.

        "title": "Open-ended Scientific Discovery via Bayesian Surprise",
        "abstract": "The promise of autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) hinges not only on\nanswering questions, but also on knowing which questions to ask. Most recent\nworks in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven\nsettings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis\ngeneration. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by\nallowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few\nexisting approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity\nheuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former\nstruggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the\nlatter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a\nmethod for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using\nBayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior\nbeliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering\nexperimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses,\nour method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive\nwidening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the\nsetting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains\nsuch as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results\ndemonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms\ncompetitors by producing 5--29\\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM.\nOur human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are\nsurprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward\ntowards building open-ended ASD systems.",

However, jailbreak prompts\ncan often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this\nwork, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts\nis decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a\ngreat deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,\nacross models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country\ncan be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.\nSurprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)\nsometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of\nrevealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the\ninternal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs\nthrough instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not\nmerely \"leftover\" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we\nfind that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise\ncomparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with\nsuppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other\ndownstream tasks.

We also introduce the TableEval benchmark, comprising 3017 tables\nfrom scholarly publications, Wikipedia, and financial reports, where each table\nis provided in five different formats: Image, Dictionary, HTML, XML, and LaTeX.\nOur findings indicate that while LLMs maintain robustness across table\nmodalities, they face significant challenges when processing scientific tables.",
