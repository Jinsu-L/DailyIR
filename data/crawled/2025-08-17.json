In\nthis paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To\nachieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs\nand demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method\ninvolves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide\nthe MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to\nindependently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's\noutput. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference\nprocess in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of\neach reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off\nobject precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving\ncontrol over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to\ncontrol the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of\nvisual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination\nbenchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM\ninference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation\nmethods.",

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this\nfield, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)\nlack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for\nsufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a\ntrajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.\nTrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation\nNetwork (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data\npreprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports\nbroadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to\nlearn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet\nlearns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual\nfeatures with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive\nloss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an\nunsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video\ndatasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,\nsoccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,\nsports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results\ndemonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video\nretrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in\naction spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action\ncategories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.\nAdditionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications\nbased on TrajSV.",

This memory is dynamically updated throughout the\ninteraction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the information\nextraction and contextual tracking capabilities.

However, existing feature interaction\nstrategies face two critical challenges in industrial applications: (1) The\nvast number of categorical and sequential features makes exhaustive interaction\ncomputationally prohibitive, often resulting in optimization difficulties. (2)\nReal-world recommender systems typically involve multiple prediction\nobjectives, yet most current approaches apply feature interaction modules prior\nto the multi-task learning layers. This late-fusion design overlooks\ntask-specific feature dependencies and inherently limits the capacity of\nmulti-task modeling. To address these limitations, we propose the Information\nFlow Network (INFNet), a task-aware architecture designed for large-scale\nrecommendation scenarios.

Building on research on fairness and\ndiscrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --\ndiscrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human\nanimals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment\nframeworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for\nreducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes\nin AI systems and the societies they influence.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nhave ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level\nperformance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU)\nand leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the\ndevelopment of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced\ngeneral-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in\nreal-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion\nArena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected\ndirectly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model\ncomparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect\npractical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the\nBradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,\na cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated\nmodels, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that\nprioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize\ninformation gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and\nsimulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable\nrankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced\ndatasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By\nfostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world\napplications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and\nMLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments.

        "abstract": "Learning unified text embeddings that excel across diverse downstream tasks\nis a central goal in representation learning, yet negative transfer remains a\npersistent obstacle. This challenge is particularly pronounced when jointly\ntraining a single encoder for Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual\nSimilarity (STS), two essential but fundamentally disparate tasks for which\nnaive co-training typically yields steep performance trade-offs. We argue that\nresolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific\nlearning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce\nCoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR\nand STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key\ninnovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives\npaired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances\nper-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a\ncontrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by\ncross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly\noptimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion\nstrategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by\nanalyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization,\nproving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient,\nsingle-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges\nstably. Extensive experiments on 15 standard IR and STS benchmarks across three\nbase encoders validate CoDiEmb. Our results and analysis demonstrate that the\nframework not only mitigates cross-task trade-offs but also measurably improves\nthe geometric properties of the embedding space.",

With advancements in\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the rising popularity of multi-agent\nsystems (MASs), synthesizing academic surveys using LLMs has become a viable\napproach, thereby elevating the need for robust evaluation methods in this\ndomain. However, existing evaluation methods suffer from several limitations,\nincluding biased metrics, a lack of human preference, and an over-reliance on\nLLMs-as-judges. To address these challenges, we propose SGSimEval, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for Survey Generation with Similarity-Enhanced\nEvaluation that evaluates automatic survey generation systems by integrating\nassessments of the outline, content, and references, and also combines\nLLM-based scoring with quantitative metrics to provide a multifaceted\nevaluation framework. In SGSimEval, we also introduce human preference metrics\nthat emphasize both inherent quality and similarity to humans.

This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that\nrepeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely\non LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation).\nThrough comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse\nresponses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to\nappear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow\ndistinct \"constellation\" patterns in embedding space as representations\ntraverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift\npredictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce\nSafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks\ntask-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal\npathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to\nover-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces\nover-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a\nprincipled approach to mitigating over-refusals.",

The models generated 2,880 answers, which we scored for\nsentiment and emotions using state-of-the-art tools. Our analysis revealed that\noptimism, fear, and sadness dominated the emotional landscape across all\noutputs, with neutral sentiment maintaining consistently high values.\nGratitude, joy, and trust appeared at moderate levels, while emotions such as\nanger, disgust, and love were rarely expressed. The choice of LLM significantly\ninfluenced emotional expression patterns. Mixtral exhibited the highest levels\nof negative emotions including disapproval, annoyance, and sadness, while Llama\ndemonstrated the most optimistic and joyful responses. The type of mental\nhealth condition dramatically shaped emotional responses: anxiety prompts\nelicited extraordinarily high fear scores (0.974), depression prompts generated\nelevated sadness (0.686) and the highest negative sentiment, while\nstress-related queries produced the most optimistic responses (0.755) with\nelevated joy and trust. In contrast, demographic framing of queries produced\nonly marginal variations in emotional tone. Statistical analyses confirmed\nsignificant model-specific and condition-specific differences, while\ndemographic influences remained minimal.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit over-refusal - erroneously\nrejecting benign queries due to overly conservative safety measures - a\ncritical functional flaw that undermines their reliability and usability.\nCurrent methods for testing this behavior are demonstrably inadequate,\nsuffering from flawed benchmarks and limited test generation capabilities, as\nhighlighted by our empirical user study. To the best of our knowledge, this\npaper introduces the first evolutionary testing framework, ORFuzz, for the\nsystematic detection and analysis of LLM over-refusals. ORFuzz uniquely\nintegrates three core components: (1) safety category-aware seed selection for\ncomprehensive test coverage, (2) adaptive mutator optimization using reasoning\nLLMs to generate effective test cases, and (3) OR-Judge, a human-aligned judge\nmodel validated to accurately reflect user perception of toxicity and refusal.\nOur extensive evaluations demonstrate that ORFuzz generates diverse, validated\nover-refusal instances at a rate (6.98% average) more than double that of\nleading baselines, effectively uncovering vulnerabilities. Furthermore,\nORFuzz's outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly\ntransferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal\nrate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets.\nORFuzz and ORFuzzSet provide a robust automated testing framework and a\nvaluable community resource, paving the way for developing more reliable and\ntrustworthy LLM-based software systems.",

        "abstract": "Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due\nto inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and\nsubstantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently\nand fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time\nand modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for\nrobustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into\npseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then\nprocesses each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual\nfeatures are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via\nintra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal\nattention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form\ncontextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal\nevolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a\ntrend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode\nnarrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event\nlevel, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To\naddress class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates\nadaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example\nmining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments\non Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

However, existing methods\nare typically limited to connecting through overlapping interacted neighbors or\nthrough similar attributes and contents. These approaches are constrained by\ncoarse-grained, sparse attributes and fail to effectively extract behavioral\ncharacteristics jointly from interaction sequences and attributes.

DQRec augments features and homogeneous linkages\nby extracting the behavior characteristics jointly from interaction sequences\nand attributes, namely patterns, such as user multi-aspect interests. Inspired\nby vector quantization (VQ) technology, we propose a new VQ algorithm, DQ-VAE,\nwhich decomposes the pre-trained representation embeddings into distinct\ndimensions, and quantize them to generates semantic IDs. We utilize the\ngenerated semantic IDs as the extracted patterns mentioned above. By\nintegrating these semantic ID patterns into the recommendation process through\nfeature and linkage augmentation, the system enriches both latent and explicit\nuser and item features, identifies pattern-similar neighbors, and thereby\nimproves the efficiency of information diffusion.

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs)\nto generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns\nacross large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to\ncapture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their\ndiagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of\npersonalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors\nbased on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past\nquestion-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that\neffectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task\nis challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which\noften lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based\ngroup-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free\ntwo-stage framework.

In the second\nstage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new\nquestions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with\nthe student's recurring misconceptions.

In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for a marketing\ntask: audience curation. To solve this, we introduce a framework called RAMP\nthat iteratively plans, calls tools, verifies the output, and generates\nsuggestions to improve the quality of the audience generated. Additionally, we\nequip the model with a long-term memory store, which is a knowledge base of\nclient-specific facts and past queries. Overall, we demonstrate the use of LLM\nplanning and memory, which increases accuracy by 28 percentage points on a set\nof 88 evaluation queries. Moreover, we show the impact of iterative\nverification and reflection on more ambiguous queries, showing progressively\nbetter recall (roughly +20 percentage points) with more verify/reflect\niterations on a smaller challenge set, and higher user satisfaction. Our\nresults provide practical insights for deploying reliable LLM-based systems in\ndynamic, industry-facing environments.",

Effective fashion recommendation systems are crucial for\nfiltering irrelevant items and suggesting suitable ones. However,\nsimultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations\nremains a significant challenge, as these aspects are often treated\nindependently in existing studies, often overlooking the complex interactions\nbetween items and user preferences. This research introduces a new framework\nnamed FGAT, inspired by the HFGN model, which leverages graph neural networks\nand graph attention mechanisms to tackle this issue. The proposed framework\nconstructs a three-tier hierarchical graph of users, outfits, and items,\nintegrating visual and textual features to simultaneously model outfit\ncompatibility and user preferences. A graph attention mechanism dynamically\nweights node importance during representation propagation, enabling the capture\nof key interactions and generating precise representations for both user\npreferences and outfit compatibility. Evaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT\noutperforms baseline models such as HFGN, achieving improved results in\nprecision, HR, recall, NDCG, and accuracy.These results demonstrate that\ncombining multimodal visual-textual features with a hierarchical graph\nstructure and attention mechanisms significantly enhances the accuracy and\nefficiency of personalized fashion recommendation systems.",

If those plans fail for reasons beyond their control, how well do\nlanguage agents search for alternative ways to achieve their goals? We devise a\nspecialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning\nproblem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for\nrelevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes\nenvironmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our\nbenchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as\nfunctions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the\nintroduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable.\nIdeally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by\nthe presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents\nstruggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment\nfeedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct\nfunction to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from\nthe environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when\nthe search space is artificially restricted.

Users can then build up AI\napplications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I\nmodels and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I\nmodels facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new\nchallenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain?\nModel selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known\nin (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target\ndomain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C,\nwhich enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model\nplatform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The\ncore of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available\nmodels and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs\ncapturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We\nthen build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and,\ncritically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph,\npredicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target\ndomain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets\nagainst three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the\nbest model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model\nfor the rest.",
