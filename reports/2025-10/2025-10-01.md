#### Abstract
> LLM-based relevance judgment generation has become a crucial approach in
advancing evaluation methodologies in Information Retrieval (IR). It has
progressed significantly, often showing high correlation with human judgments
as reflected in LLMJudge leaderboards \cite{rahmani2025judging}. However,
existing methods for relevance judgments, rely heavily on sensitive prompting
strategies, lacking standardized workflows for generating reliable labels. To
fill this gap, we reintroduce our method, \textit{Task-aware Rubric-based
Evaluation} (TRUE), for relevance judgment generation. Originally developed for
usefulness evaluation in search sessions, we extend TRUE to mitigate the gap in
relevance judgment due to its demonstrated effectiveness and reproducible
workflow. This framework leverages iterative data sampling and reasoning to
evaluate relevance judgments across multiple factors including intent,
coverage, specificity, accuracy and usefulness. In this paper, we evaluate TRUE
on the TREC DL 2019, 2020 and LLMJudge datasets and our results show that TRUE
achieves strong performance on the system-ranking LLM leaderboards. The primary
focus of this work is to provide a reproducible framework for LLM-based
relevance judgments, and we further analyze the effectiveness of TRUE across
multiple dimensions.

### 2. SQUARE: Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion and Efficient Batch Reranking for Training-free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 14
- **Authors**: Ren-Di Wu, Yu-Yen Lin, Huei-Fang Yang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26330v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 14:41:24
- **Comment**: 20 pages, 9 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: query, ranking, rerank, rag, retrieval, rank
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the area of query understanding and ranking models. The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is also related to your work in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data mining.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR)
- **Aim**: Develop a training-free framework for ZS-CIR that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
- **Rationale**: Existing ZS-CIR methods often require extensive training data and are limited in their semantic understanding. Leveraging the power of MLLMs can enhance semantic context and improve retrieval accuracy.
- **Ground**: Pre-trained Visual Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP and MLLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-4.1).
- **Experiment**: SQUARE framework is evaluated on four standard CIR benchmarks (CIRR, CIRCO, FashionIQ, and GeneCIS) using different VLMs and MLLMs.
- **Takeaway**: SQUARE achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-CIR, outperforming existing training-free methods and achieving comparable results to more complex methods. Its training-free nature, modular design, and efficiency make it a valuable tool for image retrieval applications. Future work will focus on addressing limitations in spatial reasoning and handling complex modifications.

#### Abstract
> Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

### 3. MR$^2$-Bench: Going Beyond Matching to Reasoning in Multimodal Retrieval

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Junjie Zhou, Ze Liu, Lei Xiong, Jin-Ge Yao, Yueze Wang, Shitao Xiao, Fenfen Lin, Miguel Hu Chen, Zhicheng Dou, Siqi Bao, Defu Lian, Yongping Xiong, Zheng Liu
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26378v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 15:09:14
- **Topic Keywords**: queries, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly multimodal retrieval, which requires deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization. The focus on reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval aligns with your interests in query understanding and ranking models. However, the specific domain of multimodal retrieval is not a central match to your e-commerce background.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Multimodal Retrieval
- **Aim**: To evaluate the reasoning capabilities of multimodal retrieval models.
- **Rationale**: Existing benchmarks focus on shallow semantic matching and lack diversity in image types and query structures.
- **Ground**: MR2-Bench, a new benchmark designed to prioritize reasoning tasks, encompass diverse visual content, and utilize complex queries and documents.
- **Experiment**: Evaluation of text embedding models, multimodal embedding models, and reranking techniques on MR2-Bench.
- **Takeaway**: Multimodal information is crucial for reasoning-intensive retrieval. Models designed for reasoning and reranking techniques incorporating reasoning and multimodal information achieve the highest performance.

#### Abstract
> Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI
applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and
challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level
semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess
the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual
and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a
reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents
the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond
shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,
and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural
images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple
images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting
real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived
either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of
public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,
current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,
the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but
only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the
increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further
advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and
evaluation code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench.

### 4. From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Qiyao Ma, Yunsheng Shi, Hongtao Tian, Chao Wang, Weiming Chang, Ting Yao
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25409v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-29 19:06:56
- **Topic Keywords**: query, rag
- **Reason**: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to improve the critical thinking abilities of large language models, particularly in open-domain question answering. The focus on critical thinking and correctness evaluation aligns with the user's interests in query understanding and ranking models, although the specific domain is NLP rather than IR. The paper's emphasis on real-time relevance optimization and the use of reward models also resonates with the user's research themes.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Enhancing Language Model Accuracy and Critical Thinking in Open-Domain Question Answering (QA)
- **Aim**: To develop a novel reward model, TRM, that improves the accuracy and critical thinking abilities of LLMs in open-domain QA by explicitly teaching them a structured reasoning process.
- **Rationale**: Existing outcome-supervised reward models (ORM) prioritize final answer correctness, potentially overlooking partially correct answers with misleading information. Process-supervised reward models (PRM) address this by providing sentence-level feedback but struggle to distinguish between faithfulness and factual correctness.
- **Ground**: TRM leverages a two-stage evaluation process: Faithfulness Assessment (aligning sentences with supporting documents) and Reasoning to Correctness (using internal knowledge to assess factual correctness).
- **Experiment**: TRM is trained in two phases: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). It is evaluated on a new dataset of 9423 queries and several other datasets, using metrics like correctness, usefulness, F1 score, recall, and NDCG@4.
- **Takeaway**: TRM consistently outperforms ORM and PRM baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating thinking-supervised patterns into the reward model. Explicit reasoning steps are crucial for performance, and a combination of correctness and faithfulness rewards during RL training yields the best results.

#### Abstract
> Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25459v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-29 20:07:00
- **Comment**: Haozhou Xu and Dongxia Wu are co-first authors
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of query understanding and ranking models. The focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches and their application in long-form scientific question answering aligns with your research themes. However, the specific domain of scientific simulators and long-form scientific QA is somewhat niche, which prevents a perfect match.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in scientific question answering (QA)
- **Aim**: To enhance the factuality of scientific QA by integrating scientific simulators into RAG systems.
- **Rationale**: Traditional RAG systems often struggle with generating factually accurate answers, especially for complex scientific questions.
- **Ground**: SimulRAG leverages scientific simulators to provide factual grounding for generated answers.
- **Experiment**: SimulRAG is evaluated on a new long-form scientific QA benchmark covering climate science and epidemiology.
- **Takeaway**: SimulRAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG baselines in terms of informativeness and factuality, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating simulators into RAG systems for generating more accurate scientific answers.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

### 6. RAGferee: Building Contextual Reward Models for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

- **LLM Score**: 7
- **Keyword Score**: 12
- **Authors**: Andrei C. Coman, Ionut-Teodor Sorodoc, Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro, Bill Byrne, James Henderson, Adri√† de Gispert
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26011v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 09:41:40
- **Comment**: Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main
- **Topic Keywords**: query, relevance, rag, retrieval augmented generation, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and reward models. However, its focus on contextual reward models for RAG settings and the use of question-answering datasets is not a central match to your primary focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

### 7. RE-Searcher: Robust Agentic Search with Goal-oriented Planning and Self-reflection

- **LLM Score**: 7
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Daocheng Fu, Jianbiao Mei, Licheng Wen, Xuemeng Yang, Cheng Yang, Rong Wu, Tao Hu, Siqi Li, Yufan Shen, Xinyu Cai, Pinlong Cai, Botian Shi, Yong Liu, Yu Qiao
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26048v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 10:25:27
- **Comment**: 16 pages, 7 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: query, rag, search
- **Reason**: This paper explores search technologies, specifically the robustness of search agents in complex environments, which aligns with your interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. However, the focus on large language models and their limitations is more related to NLP, but the search aspect is relevant to your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

### 8. Importance Sampling for Multi-Negative Multimodal Direct Preference Optimization

- **LLM Score**: 7
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Xintong Li, Chuhan Wang, Junda Wu, Rohan Surana, Tong Yu, Julian McAuley, Jingbo Shang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25717v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 03:24:09
- **Comment**: Preprint
- **Topic Keywords**: pairwise, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the area of multimodal direct preference optimization. Although it focuses on vision-language models, the use of importance sampling and Plackett-Luce model is relevant to your interests in ranking models and user behavior modeling. However, the paper's primary focus on multimodal direct preference optimization is not a central match to your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

### 9. On-Premise AI for the Newsroom: Evaluating Small Language Models for Investigative Document Search

- **LLM Score**: 6
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Nick Hagar, Nicholas Diakopoulos, Jeremy Gilbert
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25494v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-29 20:50:40
- **Comment**: Accepted to Computation + Journalism Symposium 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: This paper explores the application of small language models in the context of investigative document search for newsrooms, which is somewhat related to your interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. However, the focus on newsroom adoption and data security is not a central match to your primary research themes, but it does touch on aspects of query understanding and ranking models.

#### Abstract
> Investigative journalists routinely confront large document collections.
Large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
capabilities promise to accelerate the process of document discovery, but
newsroom adoption remains limited due to hallucination risks, verification
burden, and data privacy concerns. We present a journalist-centered approach to
LLM-powered document search that prioritizes transparency and editorial control
through a five-stage pipeline -- corpus summarization, search planning,
parallel thread execution, quality evaluation, and synthesis -- using small,
locally-deployable language models that preserve data security and maintain
complete auditability through explicit citation chains. Evaluating three
quantized models (Gemma 3 12B, Qwen 3 14B, and GPT-OSS 20B) on two corpora, we
find substantial variation in reliability. All models achieved high citation
validity and ran effectively on standard desktop hardware (e.g., 24 GB of
memory), demonstrating feasibility for resource-constrained newsrooms. However,
systematic challenges emerged, including error propagation through multi-stage
synthesis and dramatic performance variation based on training data overlap
with corpus content. These findings suggest that effective newsroom AI
deployment requires careful model selection and system design, alongside human
oversight for maintaining standards of accuracy and accountability.

### 10. Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities

- **LLM Score**: 6
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Andy Liu, Kshitish Ghate, Mona Diab, Daniel Fried, Atoosa Kasirzadeh, Max Kleiman-Weiner
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25369v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-29 18:19:43
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, rank
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and large language models, but it focuses on value alignment and prioritization, which is not directly related to your core research themes in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. However, the paper's use of automatic pipelines and evaluation methods may be of interest to you, particularly in the context of query understanding and ranking models.

#### Abstract
> Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

### 11. Leveraging Scene Context with Dual Networks for Sequential User Behavior Modeling

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 12
- **Authors**: Xu Chen, Yunmeng Shu, Yuangang Pan, Jinsong Lan, Xiaoyong Zhu, Shuai Xiao, Haojin Zhu, Ivor W. Tsang, Bo Zheng
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26172v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 12:26:57
- **Comment**: 12pages
- **Topic Keywords**: information retrieval, rag, user behavior, ctr, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: The paper explores sequential user behavior modeling, which is related to query understanding and user behavior modeling in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on scene context and app sub-interfaces is somewhat specific and not directly aligned with the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Modeling sequential user behaviors for future behavior prediction is crucial
in improving user's information retrieval experience. Recent studies highlight
the importance of incorporating contextual information to enhance prediction
performance. One crucial but usually neglected contextual information is the
scene feature which we define as sub-interfaces within an app, created by
developers to provide specific functionalities, such as ``text2product search"
and ``live" modules in e-commence apps. Different scenes exhibit distinct
functionalities and usage habits, leading to significant distribution gap in
user engagement across them. Popular sequential behavior models either ignore
the scene feature or merely use it as attribute embeddings, which cannot
effectively capture the dynamic interests and interplay between scenes and
items when modeling user sequences. In this work, we propose a novel Dual
Sequence Prediction networks (DSPnet) to effectively capture the dynamic
interests and interplay between scenes and items for future behavior
prediction. DSPnet consists of two parallel networks dedicated to learn users'
dynamic interests over items and scenes, and a sequence feature enhancement
module to capture the interplay for enhanced future behavior prediction.
Further, we introduce a Conditional Contrastive Regularization (CCR) loss to
capture the invariance of similar historical sequences. Theoretical analysis
suggests that DSPnet is a principled way to learn the joint relationships
between scene and item sequences. Extensive experiments are conducted on one
public benchmark and two collected industrial datasets. The method has been
deployed online in our system, bringing a 0.04 point increase in CTR, 0.78\%
growth in deals, and 0.64\% rise in GMV. The codes are available at this
anonymous github:

### 12. DeepCodeSeek: Real-Time API Retrieval for Context-Aware Code Generation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 12

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25716v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 03:23:27
- **Comment**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, API Prediction, Context-Aware Code
  Generation, Enterprise Code Completion, Reinforcement Learning, ServiceNow,
  Real-Time Code Search, Query Enhancement, Fine-Tuning, Embedding, Reranker
- **Topic Keywords**: query, rerank, rag, retrieval, rank, search
- **Reason**: The paper DeepCodeSeek focuses on real-time API retrieval for code generation, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the specific application domain (code generation) and the use of APIs and code-to-code benchmark datasets are not directly aligned with the user's core research themes in IR and NLP.

#### Abstract
> Current search techniques are limited to standard RAG query-document
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to expand the code
and index for predicting the required APIs, directly enabling high-quality,
end-to-end code generation for auto-completion and agentic AI applications. We
address the problem of API leaks in current code-to-code benchmark datasets by
introducing a new dataset built from real-world ServiceNow Script Includes that
capture the challenge of unclear API usage intent in the code. Our evaluation
metrics show that this method achieves 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy,
allowing the critical context with APIs needed for successful downstream code
generation. To enable real-time predictions, we develop a comprehensive
post-training pipeline that optimizes a compact 0.6B reranker through synthetic
dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. This
approach enables our compact reranker to outperform a much larger 8B model
while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency, effectively addressing the nuances of
enterprise-specific code without the computational overhead of larger models.

### 13. DeepJSONEval: Benchmarking Complex Nested JSON Data Mining for Large Language Models

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 11
- **Authors**: Zhicheng Zhou, Jing Li, Suming Qiu, Junjie Huang, Linyuan Qiu, Zhijie Sun
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25922v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 08:18:20
- **Topic Keywords**: query, relevance, rag, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on benchmarking complex nested JSON data mining for Large Language Models, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and NLP. However, it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest. The paper's emphasis on structured JSON generation and data comprehension is relevant to data mining, but not a central match for the user's research themes.

#### Abstract
> The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

The paper's emphasis on telecommunications and telecom network troubleshooting is also somewhat tangential to the user's primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 10:37:17
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, recommend, rank
- **Reason**: This paper proposes a discrete diffusion-based recommender system, PreferGrow, which models preference ratios and reconstructs user preferences. While it is related to recommender systems, it does not directly align with the user's primary focus on information retrieval, especially in areas requiring deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Recommenders aim to rank items from a discrete item corpus in line with user
interests, yet suffer from extremely sparse user preference data. Recent
advances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which
alleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the
collapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current
diffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise,
which is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference
data in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in
discrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based
recommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user
preferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing
diffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of
preference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item
pairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex.
This formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature
of recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of
injecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the
preferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling --
thereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference
reconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by
iteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios.
PreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical
guarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across
five benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and
empirical effectiveness.

#### Abstract
> Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, but it focuses on fairness testing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is a specific application area. While it involves ranking models and user behavior modeling, it is not directly related to the user's core research themes of query understanding, ranking models, and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

The use of reinforcement learning for efficient and transferable knowledge graph retrieval-augmented generation is an interesting application, but it is not a central match to your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

- **Topic Keywords**: pairwise, search
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), but it focuses on the evaluation of LLMs as judges rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. The study's findings on shortcut bias and recency bias in LLMs may have implications for search technologies, but the paper's primary contribution is in the NLP domain.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as
evaluators in both research and deployment.

- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 04:25:17
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on improving the truthfulness of large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning, which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the primary focus on LLMs and truthfulness is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes in IR and search technologies.

#### Abstract
> While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

However, the focus on item alignment in large-scale reading & writing tests is not directly aligned with your core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

#### Abstract
> Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn natural language interactions with users.
Given the strong interaction and reasoning skills of Large Language Models
(LLMs), leveraging LLMs for CRSs has recently emerged as a promising direction.
However, existing LLM-based methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, instead relying on unified prompts and the LLM's
internal knowledge to decide how to interact, which can lead to suboptimal
outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforced Strategy Optimization
(RSO) method for CRS, which decomposes the process of generating
strategy-driven response decisions into the macro-level strategy planning and
micro-level strategy adaptation through a network-of-experts architecture. At
the macro level, a Planner expert selects macro-level interaction strategies
(e.g., recommend, explain, encourage). At the micro level, an Actor expert
generates detailed responses conditioned on the selected macro-level strategy,
guided by auxiliary experts that provide complementary information such as user
preferences and factual grounding. This hierarchical decomposition disentangles
the optimization of different sub-tasks involved in CRS response generation,
enabling more tractable learning at each level. To address the scarcity of
high-quality multi-turn training data, we formulate strategy learning as a
reinforcement learning problem, guided by an LLM-based reward model to achieve
automatic strategy exploration. Extensive experiments show that RSO
significantly improves interaction performance compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit hierarchical strategy
optimization for CRS.

However, it is not directly focused on query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are your core areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

While it touches on natural language processing and data mining, its primary focus is on media bias and news coverage, which is somewhat related to information retrieval but not directly aligned with your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

However, its focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their tendency to hallucinate in document-based queries is not directly aligned with your primary interests in IR and Search technologies. The paper's relevance to NLP and recommender systems is also limited.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

However, the focus is on reasoning skills in Large Language Models (LLMs), which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models, but not directly aligned with user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

However, the focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its applications in multi-task fine-tuning and federated learning is not directly related to your primary interests in information retrieval, query understanding, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are
available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/ALoRA.

While it touches on aspects of query understanding and ranking models, its primary focus is on vision-language interfaces, which is somewhat related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval and NLP.

#### Abstract
> Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) for vector databases, which is related to information retrieval, but it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. The paper's emphasis on scalability and performance optimization for large-scale vector search is somewhat tangential to the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

#### Abstract
> Generation of long-form, citation-backed reports is a primary use case for
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. While open-source evaluation
tools exist for various RAG tasks, ones tailored to report generation are
lacking. Accordingly, we introduce Auto-ARGUE, a robust LLM-based
implementation of the recent ARGUE framework for report generation evaluation.
We present analysis of Auto-ARGUE on the report generation pilot task from the
TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track, showing good system-level correlations with human
judgments. We further release a web app for visualization of Auto-ARGUE
outputs.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on evaluating AI personality using human feedback, which is not directly related to Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or user behavior modeling. While it involves AI models, the context is more aligned with Natural Language Processing and recommender systems, but the specific topic of AI personality is not a core area of interest.

#### Abstract
> Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

#### Abstract
> As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on multi-behavior recommendation, which is somewhat related to information retrieval, but it primarily deals with recommender systems and does not align with the user's core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Multi-behavior recommendation leverages multiple types of user-item
interactions to address data sparsity and cold-start issues, providing
personalized services in domains such as healthcare and e-commerce. Most
existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a
unified manner, which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different
behaviors. Especially, high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors may
implicitly contain noisy signals, and frequent patterns that are plausible
while misleading, thereby hindering the learning of user intentions. To this
end, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec,
that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by
differential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically
suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through
layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions
through adaptive cross-layer feature fusion. To correct plausible frequent
patterns, we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically
adjusts the weights of negative samples. Extensive experiments on two
benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over
several state-of-the-art methods.

While it touches on model optimization and performance, it does not address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, making it somewhat tangential to your research areas.

#### Abstract
> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their ability to perform fine-grained perception tasks, which is outside the scope of your primary research interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. While it does involve some aspects of deep semantic understanding, the paper's primary contribution is in the field of computer vision and VLMs, rather than IR or NLP.

#### Abstract
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval, recommend, search
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on dimensionality reduction for nearest neighbors preservation in vector search, which is not directly related to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval, query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. Although it involves vector search, the context is more aligned with recommender systems and data mining, rather than the user's primary focus on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization in IR.

#### Abstract
> While high-dimensional embedding vectors are being increasingly employed in
various tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Recommendation Systems,
popular dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as PCA and UMAP have rarely
been adopted for accelerating the retrieval process due to their inability of
preserving the nearest neighbor (NN) relationship among vectors. Empowered by
neural networks' optimization capability and the bounding effect of Rayleigh
quotient, we propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) for k-NN preserving
dimensionality reduction. RAE constrains the network parameter variation
through regularization terms, adjusting singular values to control embedding
magnitude changes during reduction, thus preserving k-NN relationships. We
provide a rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrating that regularization
establishes an upper bound on the norm distortion rate of transformed vectors,
thereby offering provable guarantees for k-NN preservation. With modest
training overhead, RAE achieves superior k-NN recall compared to existing DR
approaches while maintaining fast retrieval efficiency.

While it involves correlation-based metrics, it does not relate to query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling in the context of Information Retrieval or Search technologies.

#### Abstract
> This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

#### Abstract
> While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at

#### Abstract
> Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

#### Abstract
> While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

While it involves Natural Language Processing, the context is code analysis rather than query understanding or ranking models.

#### Abstract
> We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

While it touches on the use of language models, the primary concern is their potential bias and neutrality, rather than their application in search or retrieval tasks.

#### Abstract
> A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

sentences (averaging over 16 words) and speakers often use them to express
generalisations about people.
  MGen is the biggest and most diverse dataset of naturally occurring generic
sentences, opening the door to large-scale computational research on
genericity. It is publicly available at https://gustavocilleruelo.com/mgen

While it involves complex reasoning tasks, it does not address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest for the user.

#### Abstract
> Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26038v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 10:14:19
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval, search
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on Chinese Grammatical Error Correction, which is not directly related to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. Although it involves large language models and example retrieval, the context and application are significantly different from the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

### 46. PerQ: Efficient Evaluation of Multilingual Text Personalization Quality

- **LLM Score**: 2
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Dominik Macko, Andrew Pulver
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25903v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 07:48:14
- **Topic Keywords**: recommend, personalization, search
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on evaluating personalization quality of text generated by language models, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and NLP. However, it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, making it less relevant to your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 06:34:21
- **Topic Keywords**: query
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on Vision-Language Models and their explanations, which is somewhat related to your interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. However, the specific context of visual explanations and user behavior in VLMs is not directly aligned with your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25757v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 04:22:42
- **Topic Keywords**: queries
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on a neuro-symbolic framework for compositional reasoning in Vision-Language Models, which is not directly related to Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or user behavior modeling. While it involves natural language processing, the context is primarily visual reasoning and does not align with the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

### 49. The Flaw of Averages: Quantifying Uniformity of Performance on Benchmarks

- **LLM Score**: 2
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Arda Uzunoglu, Tianjian Li, Daniel Khashabi
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25671v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 02:14:30
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, recommend
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on benchmark reliability and introduces a new metric called 'harmony' to measure uniformity of model performance across subdomains. While it touches on model performance and evaluation, it doesn't directly relate to query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling in information retrieval, which are core areas of your research interests.

#### Abstract
> Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

- **Submitted**: 2025-09-30 17:17:27
- **Comment**: Accepted to BlackBoxNLP 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: ctr
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on speech-to-text models and contrastive explanations, which is not directly related to your core research themes in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While it involves NLP, the specific application and methodology are not aligned with your interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.
