        "abstract": "We tackle the challenge of integrating large language models (LLMs) with\nexternal recommender systems to enhance domain expertise in conversational\nrecommendation (CRS). Current LLM-based CRS approaches primarily rely on zero-\nor few-shot methods for generating item recommendations based on user queries,\nbut this method faces two significant challenges: (1) without domain-specific\nadaptation, LLMs frequently recommend items not in the target item space,\nresulting in low recommendation accuracy; and (2) LLMs largely rely on dialogue\ncontext for content-based recommendations, neglecting the collaborative\nrelationships among entities or item sequences. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce the CARE (Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders) framework. CARE\ncustomizes LLMs for CRS tasks, and synergizes them with external recommendation\nsystems. CARE (a) integrates external recommender systems as domain experts,\nproducing recommendations through entity-level insights, and (b) enhances those\nrecommendations by leveraging contextual information for more accurate and\nunbiased final recommendations using LLMs. Our results demonstrate that\nincorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information\nsignificantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS by an average\nof 54% and 25% for ReDial and INSPIRED datasets. The most effective strategy in\nthe CARE framework involves LLMs selecting and reranking candidate items that\nexternal recommenders provide based on contextual insights. Our analysis\nindicates that the CARE framework effectively addresses the identified\nchallenges and mitigates the popularity bias in the external recommender.",

        "abstract": "Long-term user behavior sequences are a goldmine for businesses to explore\nusers' interests to improve Click-Through Rate. However, it is very challenging\nto accurately capture users' long-term interests from their long-term behavior\nsequences and give quick responses from the online serving systems. To meet\nsuch requirements, existing methods \"inadvertently\" destroy two basic\nrequirements in long-term sequence modeling: R1) make full use of the entire\nsequence to keep the information as much as possible; R2) extract information\nfrom the most relevant behaviors to keep high relevance between learned\ninterests and current target items. The performance of online serving systems\nis significantly affected by incomplete and inaccurate user interest\ninformation obtained by existing methods. To this end, we propose an efficient\ntwo-stage long-term sequence modeling approach, named as EfficieNt Clustering\nbased twO-stage interest moDEling (ENCODE), consisting of offline extraction\nstage and online inference stage. It not only meets the aforementioned two\nbasic requirements but also achieves a desirable balance between online service\nefficiency and precision. Specifically, in the offline extraction stage, ENCODE\nclusters the entire behavior sequence and extracts accurate interests. To\nreduce the overhead of the clustering process, we design a metric\nlearning-based dimension reduction algorithm that preserves the relative\npairwise distances of behaviors in the new feature space. While in the online\ninference stage, ENCODE takes the off-the-shelf user interests to predict the\nassociations with target items. Besides, to further ensure the relevance\nbetween user interests and target items, we adopt the same relevance metric\nthroughout the whole pipeline of ENCODE. The extensive experiment and\ncomparison with SOTA have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our\nproposed ENCODE.",

To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems\n(CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic\nsystems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However,\nagentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge\nfor conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between\nhandling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the\nfirst conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent\nto integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a\nuser query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency.\nFor straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool\nfor rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing\nmodule to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to\nthe intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks\nusing personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world\ncareer recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average\nresponse latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while\nsignificantly improving recommendation accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Current News Recommender Systems based on past clicks are designed for\nengagement, but come at the cost of limiting diversity in the suggested\ncontent. While diversity-aware algorithms exist, they suffer from two major\nlimitations. First, they fail to account for normative diversity, which\nrequires fair access to a broad range of perspectives. Second, they typically\napply diversity late in the system's pipeline, after a lot of content has\nalready been filtered out. Both limitations confine their effectiveness and\nprevent them from promoting true normative diversity in news recommendations.\n  We propose Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) to address these\nlimitations. Our framework introduces diversity into the earliest pipeline\nstage and uses a configurable mechanism to align diversity with specific\ndemocratic goals. A2CG represents each news article using multiple aspects of\nperspectives (e.g., sentiment, political leaning, frame) and uses a Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to create a discrete, multi-faceted\nrepresentation. A decoder-only model then learns user preferences over these\naspect codes. We then inject diversity directly by reversing the sign on some\nof the query vector's aspects during the candidate retrieval process, ensuring\na more diverse set of candidates.\n  Our method, evaluated on the MIND dataset, enables a flexible trade-off\nbetween personalization and diversity early in the recommendation pipeline. It\nalso generates more novel, diverse, and serendipitous candidates while\neffectively taking into account aspects that strengthen democratic values.\nThese empirical results make it a promising approach for downstream\ndemocratized news recommendation systems.",

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce\nsearch framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and\ntheir combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a\nflexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive\nfusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations\nwhile handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training\nstrategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),\ncohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and\nadaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated\nmultimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search\nevaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently\noutperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning\nor zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial\nimprovements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image\nretrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to\nlarger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B).

Despite their importance, research on log\nusage remains fragmented across domains, and no comprehensive study currently\nconsolidates existing efforts. This paper presents a systematic survey of log\nusage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs. More\nthan 300 publications were analyzed to address three central questions: (1) do\ndifferent types of logs share common structural and functional characteristics?\n(2) are there standard pipelines for their usage? (3) which constraints and\nnon-functional requirements (NFRs) guide their exploitation?. The survey\nreveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches, the absence of\nstandardization across log usage pipelines, and the existence of shared\nstructural elements among different types of logs. By consolidating existing\nknowledge, identifying gaps, and highlighting opportunities, this survey\nprovides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of log\nusage and sheds light on promising directions for future research, particularly\nregarding the exploitation and democratization of KG logs.",

        "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict users' subsequent interactions\nby modeling their sequential behaviors. Recent studies have explored frequency\ndomain analysis, which effectively models periodic patterns in user sequences.\nHowever, existing frequency-domain SR models still face two major drawbacks:\n(i) limited frequency band coverage, often missing critical behavioral patterns\nin a specific frequency range, and (ii) lack of personalized frequency\nfiltering, as they apply an identical filter for all users regardless of their\ndistinct frequency characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel frequency-domain model, Mixture of User-adaptive Frequency FIlteriNg\n(MUFFIN), operating through two complementary modules. (i) The global filtering\nmodule (GFM) handles the entire frequency spectrum to capture comprehensive\nbehavioral patterns. (ii) The local filtering module (LFM) selectively\nemphasizes important frequency bands without excluding information from other\nranges. (iii) In both modules, the user-adaptive filter (UAF) is adopted to\ngenerate user-specific frequency filters tailored to individual unique\ncharacteristics. Finally, by aggregating both modules, MUFFIN captures diverse\nuser behavioral patterns across the full frequency spectrum. Extensive\nexperiments show that MUFFIN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nfrequency-domain SR models over five benchmark datasets.

In this work, we present a new scaling\nparadigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting\nresources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine\nmeta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also\nfind a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query\nstrategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on\ntraining or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also\nsurprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high\nperformance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting\nexamples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These\nfindings contradict the widely held inductive bias, \"garbage in, garbage out\".\nCurating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit\nthe performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar\nquality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be\ncarefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the\nLess is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level\nreasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,\nwe are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and\nAIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with\na majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,\nthe best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25.

Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on\nmodeling interaction willingness.

First, recommendation methods\nfail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to\naccount for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two\nmodels named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to\nunleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems.

While human\nevaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks\nscalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various\nautomatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with\nhuman-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.\nOver time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic\nsimilarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it\nseems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in\nstudies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several\nkey challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,\ntheir effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain\nunstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.\nImportantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of\nmetric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and\ncoherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current\ndetectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained\nand tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to\ndomain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose\nMGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain\nfor better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text\nrepresentations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral\npatterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude\nemerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates\nthe design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the\ndocument-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic\nspectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant\nfeatures for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test\ndatasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.",

To\ntackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a\ncontinuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for\nSchema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,\nmulti-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.\nOur table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and\nrecommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent\nreviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final\nrecommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models\nsuch as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we\nhighlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema\nrecommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase\nin extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning\nprocess.

To\naddress this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)\nframework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping\nthem with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before\ndecision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)\nreward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the\namount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated\nvia Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)\nSIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to\nconstruct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)\nSIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a\nnovel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to\ninformative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two\nnewly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and\ndelivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing\nrobustly to out-of-domain cases.",

Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited\ncultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning\napproaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association\nnorms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and\nMandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt\nLlama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based\npreference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by\n16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,\nand attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on\nWorld-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions\ntoward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's\nChinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our\n7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million\nculture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly\nretraining.

However, the\neffectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and\nfactual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we\npropose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)\nrollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long\ncontext for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing\npreference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.\nSpecifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on\ntheir expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and\niteratively update these scores based on reward feedback.

        "title": "LLM-Enhanced Linear Autoencoders for Recommendation",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic\nrepresentation of textual item information in recommender systems. However,\nexisting linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely\non sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich\ntextual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of\nLLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous\nknowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase\noptimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item\ncorrelation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns\nan item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling\nsemantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is\noptimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and\ncomputational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three\nbenchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.\nThe source code is available at https://github.com/jaewan7599/L3AE_CIKM2025.",

        "title": "The Promise of Large Language Models in Digital Health: Evidence from Sentiment Analysis in Online Health Communities",
        "abstract": "Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated\nanalysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional\nand medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML\napproaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in\nhealthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these\nchallenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit\nemotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment\nAnalysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior\nperformance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,\nwith no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement\nlevels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern\nrecognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by\nin-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.\nThis approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in\ndigital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for\npatient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health\nstrategies.",

In recent years, there has been a rise in technological and\nalgorithmic solutions to measure, capture and manage trust, trustworthiness,\nand reputation in what we collectively refer to as Trust and Reputation\nManagement Systems (TRMSs). Such approaches have been developed and applied to\ndifferent domains of computer science, such as autonomous vehicles, or IoT\nnetworks, but there have not been dedicated approaches to data sharing and its\nunique characteristics. In this survey, we examine TRMSs from a data-sharing\nperspective, analyzing how they assess the trustworthiness of both data and\nentities across different environments.

We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture\nstories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a\ngeneral age from the children corpus.

The results show that LLM-generated texts are\nlonger but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and\nunder-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,\nhighlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus\nsemantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text\nto a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.\nThe findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child\nlanguage through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into\ntheir use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important\nquestions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed\neducational tools.",

        "abstract": "Multi-modal recommender system focuses on utilizing rich modal information (\ni.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation\nperformance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the\npowerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these\nmethods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although\ncontrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to\naddress the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main\nlimitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective\nrepresentations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable\ninformation in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the\nhomograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in\nincomplete mining of user-item interplay.\n  To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for\n\\textbf{R}\\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\\textbf{A}l cont\\textbf{R}astive learning\nand ho\\textbf{M}ography relations (\\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement\nmulti-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal\nconstraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and\nretain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine\nhomogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user\ninterest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user\nco-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM\nto various state-of-the-art baselines.

The\ncalibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's\nprofile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the\nrecommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the\ntotal number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a\ndifferent evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate\nin a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models\nthat help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the\nusers' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate\nthat the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the\nstructures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act\nsimilarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their\ngroups of preferences to the same degree.",
