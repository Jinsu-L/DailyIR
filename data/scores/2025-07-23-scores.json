        "abstract": "Complementary product recommendation, which aims to suggest items that are\nused together to enhance customer value, is a crucial yet challenging task in\ne-commerce. While existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches have made\nsignificant progress in capturing complex product relationships, they often\nstruggle with the accuracy-diversity tradeoff, particularly for long-tail\nitems. This paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to enhance the reranking of complementary product\nrecommendations. Unlike previous works that use LLMs primarily for data\npreprocessing and graph augmentation, our method applies LLM-based prompting\nstrategies directly to rerank candidate items retrieved from existing\nrecommendation models, eliminating the need for model retraining. Through\nextensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach\neffectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product\nrecommendations, with at least 50% lift in accuracy metrics and 2% lift in\ndiversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets.",

        "abstract": "Modern sequential recommender systems, ranging from lightweight\ntransformer-based variants to large language models, have become increasingly\nprominent in academia and industry due to their strong performance in the\nnext-item prediction task. Yet common evaluation protocols for sequential\nrecommendations remain insufficiently developed: they often fail to reflect the\ncorresponding recommendation task accurately, or are not aligned with\nreal-world scenarios.\n  Although the widely used leave-one-out split matches next-item prediction, it\npermits the overlap between training and test periods, which leads to temporal\nleakage and unrealistically long test horizon, limiting real-world relevance.\nGlobal temporal splitting addresses these issues by evaluating on distinct\nfuture periods. However, its applications to sequential recommendations remain\nloosely defined, particularly in terms of selecting target interactions and\nconstructing a validation subset that provides necessary consistency between\nvalidation and test metrics.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes can vary significantly\nacross splitting strategies, influencing model rankings and practical\ndeployment decisions. To improve reproducibility in both academic and\nindustrial settings, we systematically compare different splitting strategies\nfor sequential recommendations across multiple datasets and established\nbaselines. Our findings show that prevalent splits, such as leave-one-out, may\nbe insufficiently aligned with more realistic evaluation strategies. Code:\nhttps://github.com/monkey0head/time-to-split",

Most research in RS tends to focus either\non predicting users' immediate feedback (like click-through rate) accurately or\nimproving users' long-term engagement. However, they ignore the influence for\nauthors and the lifelong interaction value (LIV) of user-author pairs, which is\nparticularly crucial for improving the prosperity of social community in\nshort-video platforms. Currently, reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize\nlong-term benefits and has been widely applied in RS. In this paper, we\nintroduce RL to Reinforce Lifelong Interaction Value of User-Author pairs\n(RLIV-UA) based on each interaction of UA pairs. To address the long intervals\nbetween UA interactions and the large scale of the UA space, we propose a novel\nSparse Cross-Request Interaction Markov Decision Process (SCRI-MDP) and\nintroduce an Adjacent State Approximation (ASA) method to construct RL training\nsamples. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Task Critic Learning (MTCL) to\ncapture the progressive nature of UA interactions (click -> follow -> gift),\nwhere denser interaction signals are leveraged to compensate for the learning\nof sparse labels. Finally, an auxiliary supervised learning task is designed to\nenhance the convergence of the RLIV-UA model.

Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited\nworking memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model\ninference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and\nGPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as\nreasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences.\nThe reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and\nconclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During\ngeneration, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states\nof the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning\nmechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages\nthroughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high\ninference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU\nmemory.

However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet\ndata, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents\nExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a\nself-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM\nautonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts\nrobot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this\nprocess are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of\nlearned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with\nan on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection\nimproves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and\nobserve the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative\ntool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight\nunseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial\nsuccess rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and\ngeneralizability of ExpTeach.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has been widely applied in automated bidding.\nTraditional approaches model bidding as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).\nRecently, some studies have explored using generative reinforcement learning\nmethods to address long-term dependency issues in bidding environments.\nAlthough effective, these methods typically rely on supervised learning\napproaches, which are vulnerable to low data quality due to the amount of\nsub-optimal bids and low probability rewards resulting from the low click and\nconversion rates. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed these challenges.\n  In this paper, we formalize the automated bidding as a sequence\ndecision-making problem and propose a novel Expert-guided Bag Reward\nTransformer (EBaReT) to address concerns related to data quality and\nuncertainty rewards. Specifically, to tackle data quality issues, we generate a\nset of expert trajectories to serve as supplementary data in the training\nprocess and employ a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning-based discriminator to\nidentify expert transitions. To ensure the decision also meets the expert\nlevel, we further design a novel expert-guided inference strategy. Moreover, to\nmitigate the uncertainty of rewards, we consider the transitions within a\ncertain period as a \"bag\" and carefully design a reward function that leads to\na smoother acquisition of rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmodel achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding\nmethods.",

Drawing\ninspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles\nof searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep\nResearcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report\ngeneration as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a\npreliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation\nto guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through\na \"denoising\" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism\nthat incorporates external information at each step. The core process is\nfurther enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of\nthe agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the\ndiffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process\nmore timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative\nsearch process.

        "abstract": "When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to\ngenerate natural language \"reasoning chains\", their performance improves on a\nvariety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful\napplications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the\ncorrectness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize\nguessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect\nof degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate\nincorrect responses (or \"hallucinate\") in other problem domains. This paper\ndescribes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach\nto training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated\nconfidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical\nconfidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward\nfunction that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a\nscoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.\nWe first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that\nuses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both\naccurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR\nsubstantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain\nand out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and\nclassifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL\nhurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized\nconfidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration\nvia confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly\noptimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning\nmodels.",

Standard approaches to this problem rely on\nmodifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the\nintended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce\nConcept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages\ninterpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without\nneeding to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target\ndistribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding\nto undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear\nprojections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended\ngeneralizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks,\nincluding emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow\ntask generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions.\nWithout any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses\nby 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall,\nCAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without\nmodifying training data.",

However, it remains unclear whether\nusers consider these profiles to be an accurate representation of their taste,\nwhich is crucial for trust and usability.

In this paper, we study this issue in the\ncontext of music streaming, where personalization is challenged by a large and\nculturally diverse catalog. We conduct a user study in which participants rate\nNL profiles generated from their own listening histories. We analyze whether\nidentification with the profiles is biased by user attributes (e.g.,\nmainstreamness, taste diversity) and item features (e.g., genre, country of\norigin).

        "abstract": "Despite efforts to unify multimodal generation and understanding tasks in a\nsingle model, we show these MLLMs exhibit self-contradiction where generation\nproduces images deemed misaligned with input prompts based on the model's own\nunderstanding. We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such\nself-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction\nmainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather\nthan misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of\nleveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model\nunderstanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the\ngeneration-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,\nSFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation\nand unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and\nunderstanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known\nin pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows\nimprovements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously\nincorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned\ntraining dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced\nprompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the\nunderstanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of\nco-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is\nempirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics\nlike Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement,\nwhich highlights the necessity of data quality check. Finally, we propose a\ncurriculum-based strategy based on our findings that gradually introduces\nharder samples as the model improves, leading to better unification and\nimproved MLLM generation and understanding.",

To address this limitation\nand achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations.\nFirst, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by\nconceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables\nsparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby\nextending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we\npresent Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands\nthe contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter\nsize from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm.\nOur design, supported by efficient parallelized implementations, yields\neffective classification and discriminative state representations. We\nextensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures\nacross language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably\nwith state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B\nSSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among\nsmall reasoning models, scoring 64.7 on AIME24 and 51.3 on AIME25,\nsignificantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers.

Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states\npredominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their\ndynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this\nlimitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce\na novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream),\nwhich quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We\nempirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in\ndistinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a\nhallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer\nevolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe\nachieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore,\nablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying\nmechanism of this method, improving its interpretability.",

While existing\nmethods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex\ninter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and\nreliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained,\npaired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address\nthis challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset\ncalled ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We\nthen propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and\ntextual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their\ninter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity\nboundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron\n(TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from\nfine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally,\nour Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and\nglobal scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for\nfine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset,\nEntityText, generated using large language models.

        "abstract": "Active learning (AL) aims to optimize model training and reduce annotation\ncosts by selecting the most informative samples for labeling. Typically, AL\nmethods rely on the empirical distribution of labeled data to define the\ndecision boundary and perform uncertainty or diversity estimation, subsequently\nidentifying potential high-quality samples. In few-shot scenarios, the\nempirical distribution often diverges significantly from the target\ndistribution, causing the decision boundary to shift away from its optimal\nposition. However, existing methods overlook the role of unlabeled samples in\nenhancing the empirical distribution to better align with the target\ndistribution, resulting in a suboptimal decision boundary and the selection of\nsamples that inadequately represent the target distribution. To address this,\nwe propose a hybrid AL framework, termed \\textbf{PromptAL} (Sample-Aware\nDynamic Soft \\textbf{Prompts} for Few-Shot \\textbf{A}ctive \\textbf{L}earning).\nThis framework accounts for the contribution of each unlabeled data point in\naligning the current empirical distribution with the target distribution,\nthereby optimizing the decision boundary. Specifically, PromptAL first\nleverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that\nadjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Subsequently,\nbased on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation\nwith both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that more\naccurately represent the target distribution. Experimental results on six\nin-domain and three out-of-domain datasets show that PromptAL achieves superior\nperformance over nine baselines. Our codebase is openly accessible.",

Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely\ncollected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the\nearly detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over\ntime.

        "abstract": "In recent years, various methods have been proposed to evaluate gender bias\nin large language models (LLMs). A key challenge lies in the transferability of\nbias measurement methods initially developed for the English language when\napplied to other languages. This work aims to contribute to this research\nstrand by presenting five German datasets for gender bias evaluation in LLMs.\nThe datasets are grounded in well-established concepts of gender bias and are\naccessible through multiple methodologies. Our findings, reported for eight\nmultilingual LLM models, reveal unique challenges associated with gender bias\nin German, including the ambiguous interpretation of male occupational terms\nand the influence of seemingly neutral nouns on gender perception. This work\ncontributes to the understanding of gender bias in LLMs across languages and\nunderscores the necessity for tailored evaluation frameworks.",

It also explores the interaction effects between QE and MT\nquality, as well as between QE and translation expertise. The findings reveal\nthat QE significantly reduces post-editing time. The examined interaction\neffects were not significant, suggesting that QE consistently improves MTPE\nefficiency across medium- and high-quality MT outputs and among student\ntranslators with varying levels of expertise. In addition to indicating\npotentially problematic segments, QE serves multiple functions in MTPE, such as\nvalidating translators' evaluations of MT quality and enabling them to\ndouble-check translation outputs. However, interview data suggest that\ninaccurate QE may hinder post-editing processes. This research provides new\ninsights into the strengths and limitations of QE, facilitating its more\neffective integration into MTPE workflows to enhance translators' productivity.",

        "abstract": "Multimedia recommendations aim to use rich multimedia content to enhance\nhistorical user-item interaction information, which can not only indicate the\ncontent relatedness among items but also reveal finer-grained preferences of\nusers. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-aware Diffusion-Enhanced\narchitecture using contrastive learning paradigms (KDiffE) for multimedia\nrecommendations. Specifically, we first utilize original user-item graphs to\nbuild an attention-aware matrix into graph neural networks, which can learn the\nimportance between users and items for main view construction. The\nattention-aware matrix is constructed by adopting a random walk with a restart\nstrategy, which can preserve the importance between users and items to generate\naggregation of attention-aware node features. Then, we propose a guided\ndiffusion model to generate strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs with less\nnoise for constructing a knowledge-aware contrastive view, which utilizes user\nembeddings with an edge connected to an item to guide the generation of\nstrongly task-relevant knowledge graphs for enhancing the item's semantic\ninformation. We perform comprehensive experiments on three multimedia datasets\nthat reveal the effectiveness of our KDiffE and its components on various\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Using 29,124 open text summaries of\ndeath investigations between 2013-2022, we conducted a thematic analysis to\nidentify 12 types of online activities that were considered by investigators or\nnext of kin to be relevant in contextualizing a given suicide death.

This paper shifts focus from reasoning\nto perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning,\nwe introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented\nbenchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on\nsynthetic images that humans process intuitively.

The mechanisms through which this can happen are\nstill largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a\nself-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly\nmodify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through\ntheory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why\nLLMs can learn in context and not only during training.

Recently, Generative Recommenders framework was proposed to scale\nbeyond typical Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). Reformulation of\nrecommendation as sequential transduction task led to improvement of scaling\nproperties in terms of compute. Nevertheless, the largest encoder configuration\nreported by the HSTU authors amounts only to ~176 million parameters, which is\nconsiderably smaller than the hundreds of billions or even trillions of\nparameters common in modern language models.\n  In this work, we present a recipe for training large transformer recommenders\nwith up to a billion parameters. We show that autoregressive learning on user\nhistories naturally decomposes into two subtasks, feedback prediction and\nnext-item prediction, and demonstrate that such a decomposition scales\neffectively across a wide range of transformer sizes. Furthermore, we report a\nsuccessful deployment of our proposed architecture on a large-scale music\nplatform serving millions of users. According to our online A/B tests, this new\nmodel increases total listening time by +2.26% and raises the likelihood of\nuser likes by +6.37%, constituting (to our knowledge) the largest improvement\nin recommendation quality reported for any deep learning-based system in the\nplatform's history.",
