#### Abstract
> High-quality relevance judgements over large query sets are essential for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems, yet manual annotation remains costly and time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise as automatic relevance assessors, but their reliability is still limited. Most existing approaches rely on zero-shot prompting or In-Context Learning (ICL) with a small number of labeled examples. However, standard ICL treats examples as independent instances and fails to explicitly capture the underlying relevance criteria of a topic, restricting its ability to generalize to unseen query-document pairs. To address this limitation, we introduce Relevance Context Learning (RCL), a novel framework that leverages human relevance judgements to explicitly model topic-specific relevance criteria. Rather than directly using labeled examples for in-context prediction, RCL first prompts an LLM (Instructor LLM) to analyze sets of judged query-document pairs and generate explicit narratives that describe what constitutes relevance for a given topic. These relevance narratives are then used as structured prompts to guide a second LLM (Assessor LLM) in producing relevance judgements. To evaluate RCL in a realistic data collection setting, we propose a hybrid pooling strategy in which a shallow depth-\textit{k} pool from participating systems is judged by human assessors, while the remaining documents are labeled by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that RCL substantially outperforms zero-shot prompting and consistently improves over standard ICL. Overall, our findings indicate that transforming relevance examples into explicit, context-aware relevance narratives is a more effective way of exploiting human judgements for LLM-based IR dataset construction.

### 2. Welfarist Formulations for Diverse Similarity Search

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 13
- **Authors**: Siddharth Barman, Nirjhar Das, Shivam Gupta, Kirankumar Shiragur
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08742v1>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 14:42:28
- **Topic Keywords**: query, relevance, rag, retrieval, recommend, web search, search
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of nearest neighbor search and diversity. The authors develop principled welfare-based formulations that balance relevance and diversity, which is a key aspect of your research focus on query understanding and ranking models. The paper's application to retrieval-augmented generations also aligns with your interests in real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) is a fundamental problem in data structures with wide-ranging applications, such as web search, recommendation systems, and, more recently, retrieval-augmented generations (RAG). In such recent applications, in addition to the relevance (similarity) of the returned neighbors, diversity among the neighbors is a central requirement. In this paper, we develop principled welfare-based formulations in NNS for realizing diversity across attributes. Our formulations are based on welfare functions -- from mathematical economics -- that satisfy central diversity (fairness) and relevance (economic efficiency) axioms. With a particular focus on Nash social welfare, we note that our welfare-based formulations provide objective functions that adaptively balance relevance and diversity in a query-dependent manner. Notably, such a balance was not present in the prior constraint-based approach, which forced a fixed level of diversity and optimized for relevance. In addition, our formulation provides a parametric way to control the trade-off between relevance and diversity, providing practitioners with flexibility to tailor search results to task-specific requirements. We develop efficient nearest neighbor algorithms with provable guarantees for the welfare-based objectives. Notably, our algorithm can be applied on top of any standard ANN method (i.e., use standard ANN method as a subroutine) to efficiently find neighbors that approximately maximize our welfare-based objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is practical and substantially improves diversity while maintaining high relevance of the retrieved neighbors.

### 3. GISA: A Benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistant

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 7

- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 11:44:15
- **Topic Keywords**: query, queries, search
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of query understanding and ranking models. The introduction of GISA, a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants, aligns with your focus on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization. The paper's emphasis on evaluating search agents and their limitations also resonates with your interests in user behavior modeling and click models.

#### Abstract
> The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly accelerated the development of search agents capable of autonomously gathering information through multi-turn web interactions. Various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate such agents. However, existing benchmarks often construct queries backward from answers, producing unnatural tasks misaligned with real-world needs. Moreover, these benchmarks tend to focus on either locating specific information or aggregating information from multiple sources, while relying on static answer sets prone to data contamination. To bridge these gaps, we introduce GISA, a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants comprising 373 human-crafted queries that reflect authentic information-seeking scenarios. GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation. It integrates both deep reasoning and broad information aggregation within unified tasks, and includes a live subset with periodically updated answers to resist memorization. Notably, GISA provides complete human search trajectories for every query, offering gold-standard references for process-level supervision and imitation learning. Experiments on mainstream LLMs and commercial search products reveal that even the best-performing model achieves only 19.30\% exact match score, with performance notably degrading on tasks requiring complex planning and comprehensive information gathering. These findings highlight substantial room for future improvement.

### 4. Automatic In-Domain Exemplar Construction and LLM-Based Refinement of Multi-LLM Expansions for Query Expansion

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Minghan Li, Ercong Nie, Siqi Zhao, Tongna Chen, Huiping Huang, Guodong Zhou
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08917v1>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 17:16:39
- **Topic Keywords**: query, trec
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly query expansion and large language models. The proposed framework for automatic in-domain exemplar construction and refinement of multi-LLM expansions aligns with your focus on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization. While the paper's primary focus is on query expansion, it touches on related topics in NLP and data mining.

#### Abstract
> Query expansion with large language models is promising but often relies on hand-crafted prompts, manually chosen exemplars, or a single LLM, making it non-scalable and sensitive to domain shift. We present an automated, domain-adaptive QE framework that builds in-domain exemplar pools by harvesting pseudo-relevant passages using a BM25-MonoT5 pipeline. A training-free cluster-based strategy selects diverse demonstrations, yielding strong and stable in-context QE without supervision. To further exploit model complementarity, we introduce a two-LLM ensemble in which two heterogeneous LLMs independently generate expansions and a refinement LLM consolidates them into one coherent expansion. Across TREC DL20, DBPedia, and SciFact, the refined ensemble delivers consistent and statistically significant gains over BM25, Rocchio, zero-shot, and fixed few-shot baselines. The framework offers a reproducible testbed for exemplar selection and multi-LLM generation, and a practical, label-free solution for real-world QE.

### 5. Do Images Clarify? A Study on the Effect of Images on Clarifying Questions in Conversational Search

- **LLM Score**: 6
- **Keyword Score**: 9
- **Authors**: Clemencia Siro, Zahra Abbasiantaeb, Yifei Yuan, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Maarten de Rijke
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08700v1>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 14:16:11
- **Comment**: Accepted at CHIIR 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: query, queries, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of conversational search and query understanding. However, the focus on images and multimodal questions is not a central match to your primary areas of interest, which include ranking models and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Conversational search systems increasingly employ clarifying questions to refine user queries and improve the search experience. Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of text-based clarifying questions in enhancing both retrieval performance and user experience. While images have been shown to improve retrieval performance in various contexts, their impact on user performance when incorporated into clarifying questions remains largely unexplored. We conduct a user study with 73 participants to investigate the role of images in conversational search, specifically examining their effects on two search-related tasks: (i) answering clarifying questions and (ii) query reformulation. We compare the effect of multimodal and text-only clarifying questions in both tasks within a conversational search context from various perspectives. Our findings reveal that while participants showed a strong preference for multimodal questions when answering clarifying questions, preferences were more balanced in the query reformulation task. The impact of images varied with both task type and user expertise. In answering clarifying questions, images helped maintain engagement across different expertise levels, while in query reformulation they led to more precise queries and improved retrieval performance. Interestingly, for clarifying question answering, text-only setups demonstrated better user performance as they provided more comprehensive textual information in the absence of images. These results provide valuable insights for designing effective multimodal conversational search systems, highlighting that the benefits of visual augmentation are task-dependent and should be strategically implemented based on the specific search context and user characteristics.

### 6. RankGR: Rank-Enhanced Generative Retrieval with Listwise Direct Preference Optimization in Recommendation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 10
- **Authors**: Kairui Fu, Changfa Wu, Kun Yuan, Binbin Cao, Dunxian Huang, Yuliang Yan, Junjun Zheng, Jianning Zhang, Silu Zhou, Jian Wu, Kun Kuang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08575v1>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 12:13:43
- **Topic Keywords**: listwise, user behavior, retrieval, recommend, rank, search
- **Reason**: The paper RankGR focuses on recommendation systems, specifically generative retrieval, and proposes a novel method for listwise direct preference optimization. While it touches on ranking and user behavior modeling, it is primarily concerned with recommender systems, which is a related but distinct area of research from the user's core interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies.

#### Abstract
> Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a promising paradigm in recommendation systems by autoregressively decoding identifiers of target items. Despite its potential, current approaches typically rely on the next-token prediction schema, which treats each token of the next interacted items as the sole target. This narrow focus 1) limits their ability to capture the nuanced structure of user preferences, and 2) overlooks the deep interaction between decoded identifiers and user behavior sequences. In response to these challenges, we propose RankGR, a Rank-enhanced Generative Retrieval method that incorporates listwise direct preference optimization for recommendation. RankGR decomposes the retrieval process into two complementary stages: the Initial Assessment Phase (IAP) and the Refined Scoring Phase (RSP). In IAP, we incorporate a novel listwise direct preference optimization strategy into GR, thus facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the hierarchical user preferences and more effective partial-order modeling. The RSP then refines the top-λ candidates generated by IAP with interactions towards input sequences using a lightweight scoring module, leading to more precise candidate evaluation. Both phases are jointly optimized under a unified GR model, ensuring consistency and efficiency. Additionally, we implement several practical improvements in training and deployment, ultimately achieving a real-time system capable of handling nearly ten thousand requests per second. Extensive offline performance on both research and industrial datasets, as well as the online gains on the "Guess You Like" section of Taobao, validate the effectiveness and scalability of RankGR.

### 7. DA-RAG: Dynamic Attributed Community Search for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 9
- **Authors**: Xingyuan Zeng, Zuohan Wu, Yue Wang, Chen Zhang, Quanming Yao, Libin Zheng, Jian Yin
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08545v1>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 11:45:13
- **Topic Keywords**: queries, rag, retrieval, web search, search
- **Reason**: The paper DA-RAG: Dynamic Attributed Community Search for Retrieval-Augmented Generation is somewhat related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies, particularly in the context of large language models and graph-based retrieval-augmented generation. However, it does not directly focus on query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest for the user. The paper's emphasis on graph-based retrieval-augmented generation and attributed community search is an interesting aspect, but it does not align closely with the user's primary focus on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Owing to their unprecedented comprehension capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable components of modern web search engines. From a technical perspective, this integration represents retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which enhances LLMs by grounding them in external knowledge bases. A prevalent technical approach in this context is graph-based RAG (G-RAG). However, current G-RAG methodologies frequently underutilize graph topology, predominantly focusing on low-order structures or pre-computed static communities. This limitation affects their effectiveness in addressing dynamic and complex queries. Thus, we propose DA-RAG, which leverages attributed community search (ACS) to extract relevant subgraphs based on the queried question dynamically. DA-RAG captures high-order graph structures, allowing for the retrieval of self-complementary knowledge. Furthermore, DA-RAG is equipped with a chunk-layer oriented graph index, which facilitates efficient multi-granularity retrieval while significantly reducing both computational and economic costs. We evaluate DA-RAG on multiple datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms existing RAG methods by up to 40% in head-to-head comparisons across four metrics while reducing index construction time and token overhead by up to 37% and 41%, respectively.

### 8. Retrieval Pivot Attacks in Hybrid RAG: Measuring and Mitigating Amplified Leakage from Vector Seeds to Graph Expansion

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 8
- **Authors**: Scott Thornton
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08668v2>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 13:55:04
- **Comment**: 18 pages, 5 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: query, rag, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to Information Retrieval, specifically discussing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and their security implications. However, the focus is on security and leakage risks rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest. The paper's relevance to IR is somewhat tangential, but it may still be of interest to researchers exploring the intersection of IR and security.

#### Abstract
> Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines combine vector similarity search with knowledge graph expansion for multi-hop reasoning. We show that this composition introduces a distinct security failure mode: a vector-retrieved "seed" chunk can pivot via entity links into sensitive graph neighborhoods, causing cross-tenant data leakage that does not occur in vector-only retrieval. We formalize this risk as Retrieval Pivot Risk (RPR) and introduce companion metrics Leakage@k, Amplification Factor, and Pivot Depth (PD) to quantify leakage magnitude and traversal structure.
  We present seven Retrieval Pivot Attacks that exploit the vector-to-graph boundary and show that adversarial injection is not required: naturally shared entities create cross-tenant pivot paths organically. Across a synthetic multi-tenant enterprise corpus and the Enron email corpus, the undefended hybrid pipeline exhibits high pivot risk (RPR up to 0.95) with multiple unauthorized items returned per query. Leakage consistently appears at PD=2, which we attribute to the bipartite chunk-entity topology and formalize as a proposition.
  We then show that enforcing authorization at a single location, the graph expansion boundary, eliminates measured leakage (RPR near 0) across both corpora, all attack variants, and label forgery rates up to 10 percent, with minimal overhead. Our results indicate the root cause is boundary enforcement, not inherently complex defenses: two individually secure retrieval components can compose into an insecure system unless authorization is re-checked at the transition point.

### 9. When Does Context Help? Error Dynamics of Contextual Information in Large Language Models

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 8
- **Authors**: Dingzirui Wang, Xuanliang Zhang, Keyan Xu, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che, Yang Deng
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08294v1>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 05:58:41
- **Topic Keywords**: query, relevance, retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper explores the role of contextual information in large language models, which is related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on language models and contextual information in NLP is not directly aligned with the user's primary research interests in IR and search technologies. The paper's relevance is somewhat tangential to the user's core themes.

#### Abstract
> Contextual information at inference time, such as demonstrations, retrieved knowledge, or interaction history, can substantially improve large language models (LLMs) without parameter updates, yet its theoretical role remains poorly understood beyond specific settings such as in-context learning (ICL). We present a unified theoretical framework for analyzing the effect of arbitrary contextual information in Transformer-based LLMs. Our analysis characterizes contextual influence through output error dynamics. In a single-layer Transformer, we prove that the context-conditioned error vector decomposes additively into the baseline error vector and a contextual correction vector. This yields necessary geometric conditions for error reduction: the contextual correction must align with the negative baseline error and satisfy a norm constraint. We further show that the contextual correction norm admits an explicit upper bound determined by context-query relevance and complementarity. These results extend to multi-context and multi-layer Transformers. Experiments across ICL, retrieval-augmented generation, and memory evolution validate our theory and motivate a principled context selection strategy that improves performance by $0.6\%$.

### 10. Whose Name Comes Up? Benchmarking and Intervention-Based Auditing of LLM-Based Scholar Recommendation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Lisette Espin-Noboa, Gonzalo Gabriel Mendez
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08873v1>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 16:34:57
- **Comment**: 28 pages: 8 pages in main (5 figures, 1 table), 20 pages in appendix (18 figures, 2 tables). under-review
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval, recommend, web search, search
- **Reason**: The paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scholar recommendation, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the focus on LLMs and expert recommendation is not a central match to the user's core research themes, which include query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for academic expert recommendation. Existing audits typically evaluate model outputs in isolation, largely ignoring end-user inference-time interventions. As a result, it remains unclear whether failures such as refusals, hallucinations, and uneven coverage stem from model choice or deployment decisions. We introduce LLMScholarBench, a benchmark for auditing LLM-based scholar recommendation that jointly evaluates model infrastructure and end-user interventions across multiple tasks. LLMScholarBench measures both technical quality and social representation using nine metrics. We instantiate the benchmark in physics expert recommendation and audit 22 LLMs under temperature variation, representation-constrained prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via web search. Our results show that end-user interventions do not yield uniform improvements but instead redistribute error across dimensions. Higher temperature degrades validity, consistency, and factuality. Representation-constrained prompting improves diversity at the expense of factuality, while RAG primarily improves technical quality while reducing diversity and parity. Overall, end-user interventions reshape trade-offs rather than providing a general fix. We release code and data that can be adapted to other disciplines by replacing domain-specific ground truth and metrics.

### 11. Beyond Transcripts: A Renewed Perspective on Audio Chaptering

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Fabian Retkowski, Maike Züfle, Thai Binh Nguyen, Jan Niehues, Alexander Waibel
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08979v1>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 18:28:10
- **Topic Keywords**: relevance, rag, search
- **Reason**: The paper is somewhat related to Information Retrieval, specifically in the context of audio chaptering and segmentation, but it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. The focus on audio-only architecture and multimodal LLMs is more aligned with NLP and data mining, but the application domain is not directly related to e-commerce or search technologies.

#### Abstract
> Audio chaptering, the task of automatically segmenting long-form audio into coherent sections, is increasingly important for navigating podcasts, lectures, and videos. Despite its relevance, research remains limited and text-based, leaving key questions unresolved about leveraging audio information, handling ASR errors, and transcript-free evaluation. We address these gaps through three contributions: (1) a systematic comparison between text-based models with acoustic features, a novel audio-only architecture (AudioSeg) operating on learned audio representations, and multimodal LLMs; (2) empirical analysis of factors affecting performance, including transcript quality, acoustic features, duration, and speaker composition; and (3) formalized evaluation protocols contrasting transcript-dependent text-space protocols with transcript-invariant time-space protocols. Our experiments on YTSeg reveal that AudioSeg substantially outperforms text-based approaches, pauses provide the largest acoustic gains, and MLLMs remain limited by context length and weak instruction following, yet MLLMs are promising on shorter audio.

### 12. GitSearch: Enhancing Community Notes Generation with Gap-Informed Targeted Search

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Sahajpreet Singh, Kokil Jaidka, Min-Yen Kan
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08945v1>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 17:42:32
- **Comment**: 18 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: The paper's focus on targeted search and real-time retrieval is somewhat related to information retrieval, but it does not directly align with the user's core research themes of query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The paper's emphasis on community notes generation and gap-informed search is more aligned with recommender systems and NLP, but the user's primary focus is on information retrieval. The paper's relevance is limited by its domain-specific focus on community moderation and fact-checking.

#### Abstract
> Community-based moderation offers a scalable alternative to centralized fact-checking, yet it faces significant structural challenges, and existing AI-based methods fail in "cold start" scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GitSearch (Gap-Informed Targeted Search), a framework that treats human-perceived quality gaps, such as missing context, etc., as first-class signals. GitSearch has a three-stage pipeline: identifying information deficits, executing real-time targeted web-retrieval to resolve them, and synthesizing platform-compliant notes. To facilitate evaluation, we present PolBench, a benchmark of 78,698 U.S. political tweets with their associated Community Notes. We find GitSearch achieves 99% coverage, almost doubling coverage over the state-of-the-art. GitSearch surpasses human-authored helpful notes with a 69% win rate and superior helpfulness scores (3.87 vs. 3.36), demonstrating retrieval effectiveness that balanced the trade-off between scale and quality.

### 13. AMEM4Rec: Leveraging Cross-User Similarity for Memory Evolution in Agentic LLM Recommenders

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Minh-Duc Nguyen, Hai-Dang Kieu, Dung D. Le
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08837v1>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 16:06:55
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, user behavior, recommend
- **Reason**: The paper explores recommender systems using Large Language Models (LLMs), which is somewhat related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. However, the focus on recommender systems and collaborative filtering signals is not a central match to the user's primary focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The connection to Natural Language Processing (NLP) is also present, but not strong enough to elevate the score.

#### Abstract
> Agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommender systems but remain hindered by several challenges. Fine-tuning LLMs is parameter-inefficient, and prompt-based agentic reasoning is limited by context length and hallucination risk. Moreover, existing agentic recommendation systems predominantly leverages semantic knowledge while neglecting the collaborative filtering (CF) signals essential for implicit preference modeling. To address these limitations, we propose AMEM4Rec, an agentic LLM-based recommender that learns collaborative signals in an end-to-end manner through cross-user memory evolution. AMEM4Rec stores abstract user behavior patterns from user histories in a global memory pool. Within this pool, memories are linked to similar existing ones and iteratively evolved to reinforce shared cross-user patterns, enabling the system to become aware of CF signals without relying on a pre-trained CF model. Extensive experiments on Amazon and MIND datasets show that AMEM4Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders, demonstrating the effectiveness of evolving memory-guided collaborative filtering.

- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 11:57:28
- **Comment**: Work in progress
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, recommend, search, recsys
- **Reason**: The paper discusses a recommendation system (RecSys) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for user sequence modeling. While it touches on semantic understanding, which is relevant to IR, the primary focus is on recommendation systems, which is a related but secondary interest. The paper does not explicitly address query understanding, ranking models, or click models, which are core areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> With the evolution of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their rich semantic understanding to enhance industrial recommendation systems (RecSys). Traditional RecSys relies on ID-based embeddings for user sequence modeling in the General Search Unit (GSU) and Exact Search Unit (ESU) paradigm, which suffers from low information density, knowledge isolation, and weak generalization ability. While LLMs offer complementary strengths with dense semantic representations and strong generalization, directly applying LLM embeddings to RecSys faces critical challenges: representation unmatch with business objectives and representation unlearning end-to-end with downstream tasks. In this paper, we present QARM V2, a unified framework that bridges LLM semantic understanding with RecSys business requirements for user sequence modeling.

### 15. Beyond Correctness: Learning Robust Reasoning via Transfer

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Hyunseok Lee, Soheil Abbasloo, Jihoon Tack, Jinwoo Shin
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08489v1>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 10:41:44
- **Topic Keywords**: ltr, rag
- **Reason**: This paper is related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Learning to Rank, as it involves improving the robustness and generalizability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it does not directly focus on query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest. The paper's emphasis on robust reasoning and transfer rewards is somewhat relevant to the broader field of Information Retrieval, but it does not align with the user's primary research themes.

#### Abstract
> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently strengthened LLM reasoning, but its focus on final answer correctness leaves a critical gap: it does not ensure the robustness of the reasoning process itself. We adopt a simple philosophical view, robust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced it, and treat reasoning as a form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps. For example, on MATH500, RLTR achieves a +3.6%p gain in Maj@64 compared to RLVR and matches RLVR's average accuracy with roughly 2.5x fewer training steps, providing both more reliable reasoning and significantly more sample efficient.

### 16. CoRect: Context-Aware Logit Contrast for Hidden State Rectification to Resolve Knowledge Conflicts

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Xuhua Ma, Richong Zhang, Zhijie Nie
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08221v1>
- **Submitted**: 2026-02-09 02:49:21
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper discusses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and proposes a method to address knowledge conflicts. While it touches on aspects of query understanding and ranking models, its primary focus is on resolving knowledge conflicts in RAG, which is somewhat related to information retrieval but not a central match to your research interests.

#### Abstract
> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often struggles with knowledge conflicts, where model-internal parametric knowledge overrides retrieved evidence, leading to unfaithful outputs. Existing approaches are often limited, relying either on superficial decoding adjustments or weight editing that necessitates ground-truth targets. Through layer-wise analysis, we attribute this failure to a parametric suppression phenomenon: specifically, in deep layers, certain FFN layers overwrite context-sensitive representations with memorized priors. To address this, we propose CoRect (Context-Aware Logit Contrast for Hidden State Rectification). By contrasting logits from contextualized and non-contextualized forward passes, CoRect identifies layers that exhibit high parametric bias without requiring ground-truth labels. It then rectifies the hidden states to preserve evidence-grounded information. Across question answering (QA) and summarization benchmarks, CoRect consistently improves faithfulness and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines.

However, it is more focused on product recommendations and catalog coverage, which is somewhat tangential to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. The use of contrastive learning and negative sampling is an interesting aspect, but it does not directly align with the user's interests in query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Recommender systems often struggle with long-tail distributions and limited item catalog exposure, where a small subset of popular items dominates recommendations. This challenge is especially critical in large-scale online retail settings with extensive and diverse product assortments. This paper introduces an approach to enhance catalog coverage without compromising recommendation quality in the existing digital recommendation pipeline at IKEA Retail. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in negative sampling to address popularity bias, we integrate contrastive learning with carefully selected negative samples. Through offline and online evaluations, we demonstrate that our method improves catalog coverage, ensuring a more diverse set of recommendations yet preserving strong recommendation performance.

However, the focus on complex reasoning and reasoning optimization does not directly align with the user's primary interests in IR and NLP. The paper's relevance is loosely connected to the user's background in e-commerce and recommender systems.

#### Abstract
> Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) increasingly rely on reasoning traces with complex internal structures. However, existing work lacks a unified answer to three fundamental questions: (1) what defines high-quality reasoning, (2) how to reliably evaluate long, implicitly structured reasoning traces, and (3) how to use such evaluation signals for reasoning optimization. To address these challenges, we provide a unified perspective. (1) We introduce the ME$^2$ principle to characterize reasoning quality along macro- and micro-level concerning efficiency and effectiveness. (2) Built on this principle, we model reasoning traces as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and develop a DAG-based pairwise evaluation method, capturing complex reasoning structures. (3) Based on this method, we construct the TRM-Preference dataset and train a Thinking Reward Model (TRM) to evaluate reasoning quality at scale. Experiments show that thinking rewards serve as an effective optimization signal. At test time, selecting better reasoning leads to better outcomes (up to 19.3% gain), and during RL training, thinking rewards enhance reasoning and performance (up to 3.9% gain) across diverse tasks.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models are increasingly employed in generating consumer product recommendations, yet their potential for embedding and amplifying gender and race biases remains underexplored. This paper serves as one of the first attempts to examine these biases within LLM-generated recommendations. We leverage prompt engineering to elicit product suggestions from LLMs for various race and gender groups and employ three analytical methods-Marked Words, Support Vector Machines, and Jensen-Shannon Divergence-to identify and quantify biases. Our findings reveal significant disparities in the recommendations for demographic groups, underscoring the need for more equitable LLM recommendation systems.

#### Abstract
> We propose Next Concept Prediction (NCP), a generative pretraining paradigm built on top of Next Token Prediction (NTP). NCP predicts discrete concepts that span multiple tokens, thereby forming a more challenging pretraining objective. Our model, ConceptLM, quantizes hidden states using Vector Quantization and constructs a concept vocabulary. It leverages both NCP and NTP to drive parameter updates and generates a concept to guide the generation of the following tokens. We train ConceptLM from scratch at scales ranging from 70M to 1.5B parameters with up to 300B training data, including Pythia and GPT-2 backbones. Results on 13 benchmarks show that NCP yields consistent performance gains over traditional token-level models. Furthermore, continual pretraining experiments on an 8B-parameter Llama model indicate that NCP can further improve an NTP-trained model. Our analysis suggests that NCP leads to more powerful language models by introducing a harder pretraining task, providing a promising path toward better language modeling.

However, the focus on agent goals and internal representations is more aligned with NLP and AI research, but not directly applicable to search technologies or user behavior modeling. The connection to real-time relevance optimization is also tenuous.

#### Abstract
> Understanding an agent's goals helps explain and predict its behaviour, yet there is no established methodology for reliably attributing goals to agentic systems. We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives.

However, the focus on reviewer recommendation and academic peer review is not directly aligned with your primary interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an interesting aspect, but it is not a central theme in your research.

#### Abstract
> Academic peer review remains the cornerstone of scholarly validation, yet the field faces some challenges in data and methods. From the data perspective, existing research is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, verified benchmarks and oversimplified evaluation metrics that fail to reflect real-world editorial workflows. To bridge this gap, we present OmniReview, a comprehensive dataset constructed by integrating multi-source academic platforms encompassing comprehensive scholarly profiles through the disambiguation pipeline, yielding 202, 756 verified review records. Based on this data, we introduce a three-tier hierarchical evaluaion framework to assess recommendations from recall to precise expert identification. From the method perspective, existing embedding-based approaches suffer from the information bottleneck of semantic compression and limited interpretability. To resolve these method limitations, we propose Profiling Scholars with Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (Pro-MMoE), a novel framework that synergizes Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multi-task Learning. Specifically, it utilizes LLM-generated semantic profiles to preserve fine-grained expertise nuances and interpretability, while employing a Task-Adaptive MMoE architecture to dynamically balance conflicting evaluation goals. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Pro-MMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across six of seven metrics, establishing a new benchmark for realistic reviewer recommendation.

However, it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest. The paper's emphasis on fairness and responsible AI is also relevant to broader NLP and IR themes, but not a central match for the user's research focus.

#### Abstract
> Humanitarian crises demand timely and accurate geographic information to inform effective response efforts. Yet, automated systems that extract locations from text often reproduce existing geographic and socioeconomic biases, leading to uneven visibility of crisis-affected regions. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these geographic disparities in extracting location information from humanitarian documents. We introduce a two-step framework that combines few-shot LLM-based named entity recognition with an agent-based geocoding module that leverages context to resolve ambiguous toponyms. We benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art pretrained and rule-based systems using both accuracy and fairness metrics across geographic and socioeconomic dimensions. Our evaluation uses an extended version of the HumSet dataset with refined literal toponym annotations. Results show that LLM-based methods substantially improve both the precision and fairness of geolocation extraction from humanitarian texts, particularly for underrepresented regions. By bridging advances in LLM reasoning with principles of responsible and inclusive AI, this work contributes to more equitable geospatial data systems for humanitarian response, advancing the goal of leaving no place behind in crisis analytics.

While it touches on NLP, the connection to the user's research areas is somewhat tenuous. The paper's methodology and evaluation metrics are novel, but they don't seem to be directly applicable to the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> We explore the need for more comprehensive and precise evaluation techniques for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in text summarization tasks, specifically in the area of opinion summarization. Traditional methods, which leverage automated metrics to compare machine-generated summaries from a collection of opinion pieces, e.g. product reviews, have shown limitations due to the paradigm shift introduced by large language models (LLM). This paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a novel, fully automated methodology for assessing the factual consistency of such summaries. The method is based on measuring the similarity between the claims in a given summary with those from the original reviews, measuring the coverage and consistency of the generated summary. To do so, we rely on a simple approach to extract factual assessment from texts that we then compare and summarize in a suitable score. We demonstrate that the proposed metric attributes higher scores to similar claims, regardless of whether the claim is negated, paraphrased, or expanded, and that the score has a high correlation to human judgment when compared to state-of-the-art metrics.

The focus on large language models and evaluation rubrics is tangentially relevant to the user's interests in deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization, but the connection is not strong.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators for natural language generation, applying human-defined rubrics to assess system outputs. However, human rubrics are often static and misaligned with how models internally represent language quality. We introduce GER-Eval (Generating Evaluation Rubrics for Evaluation) to investigate whether LLMs can design and apply their own evaluation rubrics. We evaluate the semantic coherence and scoring reliability of LLM-defined criteria and their alignment with human criteria. LLMs reliably generate interpretable and task-aware evaluation dimensions and apply them consistently within models, but their scoring reliability degrades in factual and knowledge-intensive settings. Closed-source models such as GPT-4o achieve higher agreement and cross-model generalization than open-weight models such as Llama. Our findings position evaluation as a learned linguistic capability of LLMs, consistent within models but fragmented across them, and call for new methods that jointly model human and LLM evaluative language to improve reliability and interpretability.

However, the focus on test-time scaling and adaptive compute optimization is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The paper's relevance to natural language processing and data mining is moderate, but not a central match.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on test-time scaling via parallel decoding (for example, 512 samples) to boost reasoning accuracy, but this incurs substantial compute. We introduce CoRefine, a confidence-guided self-refinement method that achieves competitive accuracy using a fraction of the tokens via a lightweight 211k-parameter Conv1D controller atop a frozen LLM. The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification. We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility. By treating confidence as a control signal rather than a correctness guarantee, CoRefine provides a modular primitive for scalable reasoning and agentic settings with imperfect verifiers.

Although it involves multimodal retrieval, the context is limited to cultural heritage and knowledge-specific visual domains, which does not align with the user's broader interests.

#### Abstract
> Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables image retrieval by combining multiple query modalities, but existing benchmarks predominantly focus on general-domain imagery and rely on reference images with short textual modifications. As a result, they provide limited support for retrieval scenarios that require fine-grained semantic reasoning, structured visual understanding, and domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we introduce CIRThan, a sketch+text Composed Image Retrieval dataset for Thangka imagery, a culturally grounded and knowledge-specific visual domain characterized by complex structures, dense symbolic elements, and domain-dependent semantic conventions. CIRThan contains 2,287 high-quality Thangka images, each paired with a human-drawn sketch and hierarchical textual descriptions at three semantic levels, enabling composed queries that jointly express structural intent and multi-level semantic specification. We provide standardized data splits, comprehensive dataset analysis, and benchmark evaluations of representative supervised and zero-shot CIR methods. Experimental results reveal that existing CIR approaches, largely developed for general-domain imagery, struggle to effectively align sketch-based abstractions and hierarchical textual semantics with fine-grained Thangka images, particularly without in-domain supervision. We believe CIRThan offers a valuable benchmark for advancing sketch+text CIR, hierarchical semantic modeling, and multimodal retrieval in cultural heritage and other knowledge-specific visual domains. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/jinyuxu-whut/CIRThan.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) increasingly combine long-context processing with advanced reasoning, enabling them to retrieve and synthesize information distributed across tens of thousands of tokens. A hypothesis is that stronger reasoning capability should improve safety by helping models recognize harmful intent even when it is not stated explicitly. We test this hypothesis in long-context settings where harmful intent is implicit and must be inferred through reasoning, and find that it does not hold. We introduce compositional reasoning attacks, a new threat model in which a harmful query is decomposed into incomplete fragments that scattered throughout a long context. The model is then prompted with a neutral reasoning query that induces retrieval and synthesis, causing the harmful intent to emerge only after composition. Evaluating 14 frontier LLMs on contexts up to 64k tokens, we uncover three findings: (1) models with stronger general reasoning capability are not more robust to compositional reasoning attacks, often assembling the intent yet failing to refuse; (2) safety alignment consistently degrades as context length increases; and (3) inference-time reasoning effort is a key mitigating factor: increasing inference-time compute reduces attack success by over 50 percentage points on GPT-oss-120b model. Together, these results suggest that safety does not automatically scale with reasoning capability, especially under long-context inference.

While it touches on AI agents and language models, the context is focused on computational reproducibility in social science, which is not a primary area of interest for the user.

#### Abstract
> Reproducing computational research is often assumed to be as simple as rerunning the original code with provided data. In practice, missing packages, fragile file paths, version conflicts, or incomplete logic frequently cause analyses to fail, even when materials are shared. This study investigates whether large language models and AI agents can automate the diagnosis and repair of such failures, making computational results easier to reproduce and verify. We evaluate this using a controlled reproducibility testbed built from five fully reproducible R-based social science studies. Realistic failures were injected, ranging from simple issues to complex missing logic, and two automated repair workflows were tested in clean Docker environments. The first workflow is prompt-based, repeatedly querying language models with structured prompts of varying context, while the second uses agent-based systems that inspect files, modify code, and rerun analyses autonomously. Across prompt-based runs, reproduction success ranged from 31-79 percent, with performance strongly influenced by prompt context and error complexity. Complex cases benefited most from additional context. Agent-based workflows performed substantially better, with success rates of 69-96 percent across all complexity levels. These results suggest that automated workflows, especially agent-based systems, can significantly reduce manual effort and improve reproduction success across diverse error types. Unlike prior benchmarks, our testbed isolates post-publication repair under controlled failure modes, allowing direct comparison of prompt-based and agent-based approaches.

Although it involves sentence encoders and embeddings, which are related to NLP, the focus is on comparing and visualizing encoders using quantum relative entropy, which is not a core area of your research.

#### Abstract
> We propose a method to compare and visualise sentence encoders at scale by creating a map of encoders where each sentence encoder is represented in relation to the other sentence encoders. Specifically, we first represent a sentence encoder using an embedding matrix of a sentence set, where each row corresponds to the embedding of a sentence. Next, we compute the Pairwise Inner Product (PIP) matrix for a sentence encoder using its embedding matrix. Finally, we create a feature vector for each sentence encoder reflecting its Quantum Relative Entropy (QRE) with respect to a unit base encoder. We construct a map of encoders covering 1101 publicly available sentence encoders, providing a new perspective of the landscape of the pre-trained sentence encoders. Our map accurately reflects various relationships between encoders, where encoders with similar attributes are proximally located on the map. Moreover, our encoder feature vectors can be used to accurately infer downstream task performance of the encoders, such as in retrieval and clustering tasks, demonstrating the faithfulness of our map.

While it touches on the idea of understanding diverse perspectives, it does not directly relate to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding, which are the core areas of your research interests.

#### Abstract
> Pluralism, the capacity to engage with diverse perspectives without collapsing them into a single viewpoint, is critical for developing large language models that faithfully reflect human heterogeneity. Yet this characteristic has not been carefully examined in the LLM research community and remains absent from most alignment studies. Debate-oriented sources provide a natural entry point for pluralism research. Previous work builds on online debate sources but remains constrained by costly human validation. Other debate-rich platforms such as Reddit and Kialo also offer promising material: Reddit provides linguistic diversity and scale but lacks clear argumentative structure, while Kialo supplies explicit pro/con graphs but remains overly concise and detached from natural discourse. We introduce PERSPECTRA, a pluralist benchmark that integrates the structural clarity of Kialo debate graphs with the linguistic diversity of real Reddit discussions. Using a controlled retrieval-and-expansion pipeline, we construct 3,810 enriched arguments spanning 762 pro/con stances on 100 controversial topics. Each opinion is expanded to multiple naturalistic variants, enabling robust evaluation of pluralism. We initialise three tasks with PERSPECTRA: opinion counting (identifying distinct viewpoints), opinion matching (aligning supporting stances and discourse to source opinions), and polarity check (inferring aggregate stance in mixed discourse). Experiments with state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, highlight systematic failures, such as overestimating the number of viewpoints and misclassifying concessive structures, underscoring the difficulty of pluralism-aware understanding and reasoning. By combining diversity with structure, PERSPECTRA establishes the first scalable, configurable benchmark for evaluating how well models represent, distinguish, and reason over multiple perspectives.

While it involves retrieval methods, the context is distinct from query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest. The paper's emphasis on generative subgraph retrieval and agent memory systems does not align with the user's primary research themes.

#### Abstract
> Memory mechanism is a core component of LLM-based agents, enabling reasoning and knowledge discovery over long-horizon contexts. Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in long-context processing, including quadratic computational costs, information forgetting, and the context fragmentation inherent in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a cognitively inspired framework for efficient long-context inference based on chunk-wise compression and selective memory recall, rather than processing all raw tokens. The framework segments long inputs into chunks and encodes each chunk into compressed memory representations using a learned compressor. A gating module dynamically selects relevant memory blocks, which are then iteratively processed by a reasoning module with an evolving working memory to solve downstream tasks. The compressor and reasoner are jointly optimized via end-to-end reinforcement learning, while the gating module is trained separately as a classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks such as RULER-HQA, extrapolates context length from 7K to 1.75M tokens, and offers a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to strong long-context baselines. In particular, it achieves up to a 2 times reduction in peak GPU memory usage and a 6 times inference speedup over MemAgent.

> Automated judgment document generation is a significant yet challenging legal AI task. As the conclusive written instrument issued by a court, a judgment document embodies complex legal reasoning. However, existing methods often oversimplify this complex process, particularly by omitting the ``Pre-Judge'' phase, a crucial step where human judges form a preliminary conclusion. This omission leads to two core challenges: 1) the ineffective acquisition of foundational judicial elements, and 2) the inadequate modeling of the Pre-Judge process, which collectively undermine the final document's legal soundness. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{\textbf{J}udicial \textbf{U}nified \textbf{S}ynthesis \textbf{T}hrough \textbf{I}ntermediate \textbf{C}onclusion \textbf{E}mulation} (JUSTICE), a novel framework that emulates the ``Search $\rightarrow$ Pre-Judge $\rightarrow$ Write'' cognitive workflow of human judges. Specifically, it introduces the Pre-Judge stage through three dedicated components: Referential Judicial Element Retriever (RJER), Intermediate Conclusion Emulator (ICE), and Judicial Unified Synthesizer (JUS). RJER first retrieves legal articles and a precedent case to establish a referential foundation. ICE then operationalizes the Pre-Judge phase by generating a verifiable intermediate conclusion. Finally, JUS synthesizes these inputs to craft the final judgment. Experiments on both an in-domain legal benchmark and an out-of-distribution dataset show that JUSTICE significantly outperforms strong baselines, with substantial gains in legal accuracy, including a 4.6\% improvement in prison term prediction. Our findings underscore the importance of explicitly modeling the Pre-Judge process to enhance the legal coherence and accuracy of generated judgment documents.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on efficient tuning of graph-based nearest neighbor search algorithms, which is not directly related to the user's core research interests in Information Retrieval, query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. While it involves vector similarity search, a related topic, the specific application and approach are not aligned with the user's primary focus on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Vector similarity search is an essential primitive in modern AI and ML applications. Most vector databases adopt graph-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms, such as DiskANN (Subramanya et al., 2019), which have demonstrated state-of-the-art empirical performance. DiskANN's graph construction is governed by a reachability parameter $α$, which gives a trade-off between construction time, query time, and accuracy. However, adaptively tuning this trade-off typically requires rebuilding the index for different $α$ values, which is prohibitive at scale. In this work, we propose RP-Tuning, an efficient post-hoc routine, based on DiskANN's pruning step, to adjust the $α$ parameter without reconstructing the full index. Within the $α$-reachability framework of prior theoretical works (Indyk and Xu, 2023; Gollapudi et al., 2025), we prove that pruning an initially $α$-reachable graph with RP-Tuning preserves worst-case reachability guarantees in general metrics and improved guarantees in Euclidean metrics. Empirically, we show that RP-Tuning accelerates DiskANN tuning on four public datasets by up to $43\times$ with negligible overhead.

While it touches on the idea of routing, which is a concept that can be applied to search systems, the context is not directly relevant to the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> Of the over 7,000 languages spoken in the world, commercial language identification (LID) systems only reliably identify a few hundred in written form. Research-grade systems extend this coverage under certain circumstances, but for most languages coverage remains patchy or nonexistent. This position paper argues that this situation is largely self-imposed. In particular, it arises from a persistent framing of LID as decontextualized text classification, which obscures the central role of prior probability estimation and is reinforced by institutional incentives that favor global, fixed-prior models. We argue that improving coverage for tail languages requires rethinking LID as a routing problem and developing principled ways to incorporate environmental cues that make languages locally plausible.

- **Reason**: This paper is about sequential recommendation, which is somewhat related to information retrieval, but it focuses on recommender systems and does not address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest for you.

#### Abstract
> Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict a user's next action by learning from their historical interaction sequences. In real-world applications, these models require periodic updates to adapt to new interactions and evolving user preferences. While incremental learning methods facilitate these updates, they face significant challenges. Replay-based approaches incur high memory and computational costs, and regularization-based methods often struggle to discard outdated or conflicting knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose SA-CAISR, a Stage-Adaptive and Conflict-Aware Incremental Sequential Recommendation framework. As a buffer-free framework, SA-CAISR operates using only the old model and new data, directly addressing the high costs of replay-based techniques. SA-CAISR introduces a novel Fisher-weighted knowledge-screening mechanism that dynamically identifies outdated knowledge by estimating parameter-level conflicts between the old model and new data, allowing our approach to selectively remove obsolete knowledge while preserving compatible historical patterns. This dynamic balance between stability and adaptability allows our method to achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in incremental SR. Specifically, SA-CAISR improves Recall@20 by 2.0%, MRR@20 by 1.2%, and NDCG@20 by 1.4% on average across datasets, while reducing memory usage by 97.5% and training time by 46.9% compared to the best baselines. This efficiency allows real-world systems to rapidly update user profiles with minimal computational overhead, ensuring more timely and accurate recommendations.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on generative recommendation and item tokenization, which is somewhat related to information retrieval, but it does not directly address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. The paper's emphasis on recommender systems and scalability in industrial environments also diverges from the user's primary focus on information retrieval and deep semantic understanding.

#### Abstract
> Generative Recommendation has revolutionized recommender systems by reformulating retrieval as a sequence generation task over discrete item identifiers. Despite the progress, existing approaches typically rely on static, decoupled tokenization that ignores collaborative signals. While recent methods attempt to integrate collaborative signals into item identifiers either during index construction or through end-to-end modeling, they encounter significant challenges in real-world production environments. Specifically, the volatility of collaborative signals leads to unstable tokenization, and current end-to-end strategies often devolve into suboptimal two-stage training rather than achieving true co-evolution. To bridge this gap, we propose PIT, a dynamic Personalized Item Tokenizer framework for end-to-end generative recommendation, which employs a co-generative architecture that harmonizes collaborative patterns through collaborative signal alignment and synchronizes item tokenizer with generative recommender via a co-evolution learning. This enables the dynamic, joint, end-to-end evolution of both index construction and recommendation. Furthermore, a one-to-many beam index ensures scalability and robustness, facilitating seamless integration into large-scale industrial deployments. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PIT consistently outperforms competitive baselines. In a large-scale deployment at Kuaishou, an online A/B test yielded a substantial 0.402% uplift in App Stay Time, validating the framework's effectiveness in dynamic industrial environments.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of attention mechanisms in deep learning models, specifically for long-context LLM pre-filling. While it touches on the concept of attention, which is related to ranking models, the paper's primary focus is on accelerating model computations rather than query understanding, ranking, or user behavior modeling, making it somewhat tangential to your core research interests.

#### Abstract
> Block-sparse attention is promising for accelerating long-context LLM pre-filling, yet identifying relevant blocks efficiently remains a bottleneck. Existing methods typically employ coarse-grained attention as a proxy for block importance estimation, but often resort to expensive token-level searching or scoring, resulting in significant selection overhead. In this work, we trace the inaccuracy of standard coarse-grained attention via mean pooling to a theoretical root cause: the interaction between mean pooling and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a "blind spot" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency. Extensive evaluations confirm that Prism maintains accuracy parity with full attention while delivering up to $\mathbf{5.1\times}$ speedup.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on KV-cache compression and Euclidean outlier detection, which is not directly related to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While it involves ranking models, the context is specific to cache compression and does not align with the user's interests in query understanding, ranking models for information retrieval, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Long-context inference is constrained by KV-cache memory, which grows linearly with sequence length; KV-cache compression therefore hinges on reliably selecting which past tokens to retain. Most geometry-based eviction methods score keys by cosine similarity to a global centroid, but cosine is scale-invariant and can discard magnitude cues that distinguish semantically salient tokens. We propose ManifoldKV, a training-free scorer that ranks tokens by Euclidean distance to the key centroid, capturing both angular and radial deviations.
  On the RULER benchmark, ManifoldKV achieves 95.7% accuracy at 4K-16K contexts with 20% compression; matching the best geometric baseline while improving robustness in two regimes where cosine scoring fails. First, on multi-key retrieval, ManifoldKV reduces directional collisions, achieving 92.4% vs KeyDiff's 77.0% (+15.4 points) on 3-key NIAH at 50% compression. Second, to address dilution and performance collapse of global centroids at 64K context, we introduce WindowedManifoldKV, which restores accuracy to 84.3% at 25% compression, a 49-point recovery over global L2 and +3.2 points over KeyDiff. The method requires only 3 lines of code and works across 4 architectures without tuning.

While it touches on the concept of 'cognitive gap', it's more focused on GUI-agent defense and CAPTCHA systems, which doesn't align with the user's primary interests.

#### Abstract
> The rapid evolution of GUI-enabled agents has rendered traditional CAPTCHAs obsolete. While previous benchmarks like OpenCaptchaWorld established a baseline for evaluating multimodal agents, recent advancements in reasoning-heavy models, such as Gemini3-Pro-High and GPT-5.2-Xhigh have effectively collapsed this security barrier, achieving pass rates as high as 90% on complex logic puzzles like "Bingo". In response, we introduce Next-Gen CAPTCHAs, a scalable defense framework designed to secure the next-generation web against the advanced agents. Unlike static datasets, our benchmark is built upon a robust data generation pipeline, allowing for large-scale and easily scalable evaluations, notably, for backend-supported types, our system is capable of generating effectively unbounded CAPTCHA instances. We exploit the persistent human-agent "Cognitive Gap" in interactive perception, memory, decision-making, and action. By engineering dynamic tasks that require adaptive intuition rather than granular planning, we re-establish a robust distinction between biological users and artificial agents, offering a scalable and diverse defense mechanism for the agentic era.

#### Abstract
> GUI agents have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating interactions in digital environments, yet achieving both broad generality and consistently strong task performance remains challenging.In this report, we present UI-Venus-1.5, a unified, end-to-end GUI Agent designed for robust real-world applications.The proposed model family comprises two dense variants (2B and 8B) and one mixture-of-experts variant (30B-A3B) to meet various downstream application scenarios.Compared to our previous version, UI-Venus-1.5 introduces three key technical advances: (1) a comprehensive Mid-Training stage leveraging 10 billion tokens across 30+ datasets to establish foundational GUI semantics; (2) Online Reinforcement Learning with full-trajectory rollouts, aligning training objectives with long-horizon, dynamic navigation in large-scale environments; and (3) a single unified GUI Agent constructed via Model Merging, which synthesizes domain-specific models (grounding, web, and mobile) into one cohesive checkpoint. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UI-Venus-1.5 establishes new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot-Pro (69.6%), VenusBench-GD (75.0%), and AndroidWorld (77.6%), significantly outperforming previous strong baselines. In addition, UI-Venus-1.5 demonstrates robust navigation capabilities across a variety of Chinese mobile apps, effectively executing user instructions in real-world scenarios.

#### Abstract
> Privacy is a human right that sustains patient-provider trust. Clinical notes capture a patient's private vulnerability and individuality, which are used for care coordination and research. Under HIPAA Safe Harbor, these notes are de-identified to protect patient privacy. However, Safe Harbor was designed for an era of categorical tabular data, focusing on the removal of explicit identifiers while ignoring the latent information found in correlations between identity and quasi-identifiers, which can be captured by modern LLMs. We first formalize these correlations using a causal graph, then validate it empirically through individual re-identification of patients from scrubbed notes. The paradox of de-identification is further shown through a diagnosis ablation: even when all other information is removed, the model can predict the patient's neighborhood based on diagnosis alone. This position paper raises the question of how we can act as a community to uphold patient-provider trust when de-identification is inherently imperfect. We aim to raise awareness and discuss actionable recommendations.

However, it is not directly related to information retrieval, query understanding, ranking models, or deep semantic understanding, which are core areas of your research interests.

#### Abstract
> Computer-use agents (CUAs) have made tremendous progress in the past year, yet they still frequently produce misaligned actions that deviate from the user's original intent. Such misaligned actions may arise from external attacks (e.g., indirect prompt injection) or from internal limitations (e.g., erroneous reasoning). They not only expose CUAs to safety risks, but also degrade task efficiency and reliability. This work makes the first effort to define and study misaligned action detection in CUAs, with comprehensive coverage of both externally induced and internally arising misaligned actions. We further identify three common categories in real-world CUA deployment and construct MisActBench, a benchmark of realistic trajectories with human-annotated, action-level alignment labels. Moreover, we propose DeAction, a practical and universal guardrail that detects misaligned actions before execution and iteratively corrects them through structured feedback. DeAction outperforms all existing baselines across offline and online evaluations with moderate latency overhead: (1) On MisActBench, it outperforms baselines by over 15% absolute in F1 score; (2) In online evaluation, it reduces attack success rate by over 90% under adversarial settings while preserving or even improving task success rate in benign environments.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on A/B testing in social platforms, addressing spillover effects in networked environments. While it involves experimentation and statistical analysis, it does not directly relate to the user's core research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or Natural Language Processing.

#### Abstract
> A/B testing is the foundation of decision-making in online platforms, yet social products often suffer from network interference: user interactions cause treatment effects to spill over into the control group. Such spillovers bias causal estimates and undermine experimental conclusions. Existing approaches face key limitations: user-level randomization ignores network structure, while cluster-based methods often rely on general-purpose clustering that is not tailored for spillover containment and has difficulty balancing unbiasedness and statistical power at scale. We propose a spillover-contained experimentation framework with two stages. In the pre-experiment stage, we build social interaction graphs and introduce a Balanced Louvain algorithm that produces stable, size-balanced clusters while minimizing cross-cluster edges, enabling reliable cluster-based randomization. In the post-experiment stage, we develop a tailored CUPAC estimator that leverages pre-experiment behavioral covariates to reduce the variance induced by cluster-level assignment, thereby improving statistical power. Together, these components provide both structural spillover containment and robust statistical inference. We validate our approach through large-scale social sharing experiments on Kuaishou, a platform serving hundreds of millions of users. Results show that our method substantially reduces spillover and yields more accurate assessments of social strategies than traditional user-level designs, establishing a reliable and scalable framework for networked A/B testing.

#### Abstract
> Addressing the critical need for robust safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly against adversarial attacks and in-distribution errors, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Backtracking Feedback (RLBF). This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient "backtrack by x tokens" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility.

While it involves multimodal environments and webpages, the emphasis is on planning and perception rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Real-world autonomous planning requires coordinating tightly coupled constraints where a single decision dictates the feasibility of all subsequent actions. However, existing benchmarks predominantly feature loosely coupled constraints solvable through local greedy decisions and rely on idealized data, failing to capture the complexity of extracting parameters from dynamic web environments. We introduce \textbf{WorldTravel}, a benchmark comprising 150 real-world travel scenarios across 5 cities that demand navigating an average of 15+ interdependent temporal and logical constraints. To evaluate agents in realistic deployments, we develop \textbf{WorldTravel-Webscape}, a multi-modal environment featuring over 2,000 rendered webpages where agents must perceive constraint parameters directly from visual layouts to inform their planning. Our evaluation of 10 frontier models reveals a significant performance collapse: even the state-of-the-art GPT-5.2 achieves only 32.67\% feasibility in text-only settings, which plummets to 19.33\% in multi-modal environments. We identify a critical Perception-Action Gap and a Planning Horizon threshold at approximately 10 constraints where model reasoning consistently fails, suggesting that perception and reasoning remain independent bottlenecks. These findings underscore the need for next-generation agents that unify high-fidelity visual perception with long-horizon reasoning to handle brittle real-world logistics.

#### Abstract
> Solving open-ended science questions remains challenging for large language models, particularly due to inherently unreliable supervision and evaluation. The bottleneck lies in the data construction and reward design for scientific post-training. We develop a large-scale, systematic data processing pipeline that transforms heterogeneous open-source science data into Dr. SCI dataset, which comprises of 1M questions across eight STEM subjects, with explicit verifiable/open-ended splits, scalable difficulty annotation, and fine-grained rubrics that operationalize evaluation for open-ended answers. Building on this dataset, we propose the Dr. SCI post-training pipeline, which redesigns the standard SFT -> RL workflow through three components: (i) Exploration-Expanding SFT, which broadens the model's reasoning pattern coverage prior to RL; (ii) Dynamic Difficulty Curriculum, which adapts training data to the model's evolving scientific capability; and (iii) SciRubric-Guided RL, which enables stable reinforcement learning on open-ended scientific questions via rubric-based evaluation with explicit answer correctness. Qwen3-4B-Base trained using Dr. SCI pipeline achieves 63.2 on GPQA-diamond and 32.4 on GPQA-general, consistently improves over strong post-trained baselines such as o1-mini and GPT-4o, demonstrating substantial gains in scientific reasoning, especially in open-ended settings.

While it involves text encoding and representation, the domain-specific knowledge and application in the judicial domain make it less relevant to the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> With the continuous progress of digitization in Chinese judicial institutions, a substantial amount of electronic legal document information has been accumulated. To unlock its potential value, entity and relation extraction for legal documents has emerged as a crucial task. However, existing methods often lack domain-specific knowledge and fail to account for the unique characteristics of the judicial domain. In this paper, we propose an entity and relation extraction algorithm based on hypergraph neural network (Legal-KAHRE) for drug-related judgment documents. Firstly, we design a candidate span generator based on neighbor-oriented packing strategy and biaffine mechanism, which identifies spans likely to contain entities. Secondly, we construct a legal dictionary with judicial domain knowledge and integrate it into text encoding representation using multi-head attention. Additionally, we incorporate domain-specific cases like joint crimes and combined punishment for multiple crimes into the hypergraph structure design. Finally, we employ a hypergraph neural network for higher-order inference via message passing. Experimental results on the CAIL2022 information extraction dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baseline models.

The topic is more aligned with Natural Language Processing and deep learning, but it does not address any of the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their inherent support for parallel decoding. Building on this paradigm, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) dLLMs with autoregressive (AR) initialization have further demonstrated strong performance competitive with mainstream AR models. However, we identify a fundamental mismatch between MoE architectures and diffusion-based decoding. Specifically, a large number of experts are activated at each denoising step, while only a small subset of tokens is ultimately accepted, resulting in substantial inference overhead and limiting their deployment in latency-sensitive applications. In this work, we propose TEAM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates MoE dLLMs by enabling more accepted tokens with fewer activated experts. TEAM is motivated by the observation that expert routing decisions exhibit strong temporal consistency across denoising levels as well as spatial consistency across token positions. Leveraging these properties, TEAM employs three complementary expert activation and decoding strategies, conservatively selecting necessary experts for decoded and masked tokens and simultaneously performing aggressive speculative exploration across multiple candidates. Experimental results demonstrate that TEAM achieves up to 2.2x speedup over vanilla MoE dLLM, with negligible performance degradation.
