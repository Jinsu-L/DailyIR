        "title": "CardRewriter: Leveraging Knowledge Cards for Long-Tail Query Rewriting on Short-Video Platforms",
        "abstract": "Short-video platforms have rapidly become a new generation of information\nretrieval systems, where users formulate queries to access desired videos.\nHowever, user queries, especially long-tail ones, often suffer from spelling\nerrors, incomplete phrasing, and ambiguous intent, resulting in mismatches\nbetween user expectations and retrieved results. While large language models\n(LLMs) have shown success in long-tail query rewriting within e-commerce, they\nstruggle on short-video platforms, where proprietary content such as short\nvideos, live streams, micro dramas, and user social networks falls outside\ntheir training distribution. To address this challenge, we introduce\n\\textbf{CardRewriter}, an LLM-based framework that incorporates domain-specific\nknowledge to enhance long-tail query rewriting. For each query, our method\naggregates multi-source knowledge relevant to the query and summarizes it into\nan informative and query-relevant knowledge card. This card then guides the LLM\nto better capture user intent and produce more effective query rewrites. We\noptimize CardRewriter using a two-stage training pipeline: supervised\nfine-tuning followed by group relative policy optimization, with a tailored\nreward system balancing query relevance and retrieval effectiveness. Offline\nexperiments show that CardRewriter substantially improves rewriting quality for\nqueries targeting proprietary content. Online A/B testing further confirms\nsignificant gains in long-view rate (LVR) and click-through rate (CTR), along\nwith a notable reduction in initiative query reformulation rate (IQRR). Since\nSeptember 2025, CardRewriter has been deployed on Kuaishou, one of China's\nlargest short-video platforms, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.",

        "abstract": "Accurately modeling query-item relevance drives e-commerce ranking, yet\nlong-tail, knowledge-heavy, and fast-evolving queries exceed parametric LLM\ncoverage. External context (reviews, attribute encyclopedias, UGC) can help but\nis noisy, and single-pass latency and cost forbid any clean-then-summarize\nstep. The model must, per query, judge relevance and decide whether to use,\npartially use, or ignore the context. DyKnow-RAG is a dynamic noisy-RAG\nframework built on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It trains two rollout\ngroups (no external context vs a single retrieved chunk) and applies\nposterior-driven inter-group advantage scaling that adaptively reweights their\ncontributions by the per-query correctness gap. This teaches when to trust\nretrieval versus fall back to parametric knowledge, without process labels,\nvalue networks, or extra inference passes, preserving single-pass, single-chunk\ndeployment under production latency. Training combines: (1) supervised\ninitialization with a structured rationale that explicitly records the\ncontext-usage decision; (2) an RL pool prioritized by SFT uncertainty to focus\nwhere context choice is most consequential; and (3) an optional lightweight DPO\nwarm start to stabilize with-context calibration. Under a unified\nretrieval/index and fixed latency budget, DyKnow-RAG outperforms SFT, DPO, and\nvanilla GRPO in offline tests, and delivers consistent lifts on GSB, Query\nGoodrate, and Item Goodrate in Taobao A/B testing. It is deployed in Taobao's\nproduction relevance system, serving live traffic.

However, existing\ndense retrieval methods often struggle to capture fine-grained scientific\nconcepts in texts due to their reliance on holistic embeddings and limited\ndomain understanding. Recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs)\nto extract fine-grained semantic entities and enhance semantic matching, but\nthey typically treat entities as independent fragments, overlooking the\nmulti-faceted nature of scientific concepts. To address this limitation, we\npropose Pairwise Semantic Matching (PairSem), a framework that represents\nrelevant semantics as entity-aspect pairs, capturing complex, multi-faceted\nscientific concepts. PairSem is unsupervised, base retriever-agnostic, and\nplug-and-play, enabling precise and context-aware matching without requiring\nquery-document labels or entity annotations.

However, existing approaches\ntypically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and\nmultimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained\ninteractions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper,\nwe propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a\nmodality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between\nID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user\ninterest modeling.

Existing generative\nparadigms attempt to address this but suffer from critical limitations: Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) based methods create a semantic mismatch by forcing\ne-commerce signals into a linguistic space, while ID-based generation is\nconstrained by item memorization and cold-start issues. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel generative pre-training paradigm. Our model\nlearns to predict the Next Interest Flow, a dense vector sequence representing\na user's future intent, while simultaneously modeling its internal Interest\nDiversity and Interest Evolution Velocity to ensure the representation is both\nrich and coherent. However, this two-stage approach introduces a critical\nobjective mismatch between the generative and discriminative stages. We resolve\nthis via a bidirectional alignment strategy, which harmonizes the two stages\nthrough cross-stage weight initialization and a dynamic Semantic Alignment\nModule for fine-tuning. Additionally, we enhance the underlying discriminative\nmodel with a Temporal Sequential Pairwise (TSP) mechanism to better capture\ntemporal causality.

This review\nsystematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of\ninference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two\ncomprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods.\nOutput-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies,\nincluding reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding\nmethods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO),\nand model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized\nby few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further\ndetailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval\nand reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.",

While traditional retrieval focuses on\nrelevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,\ni.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and\ncomprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic\nattribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from\nthe same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension\nability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion\nof LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple\ndatasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal\nfor LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across\ndifferent LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the\nLLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some\nhuman-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific\nLLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for\nLLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,\nwe propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We\nevaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while\nverbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to\nassess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and\nto select truly useful ones for unknown queries.",

Nevertheless, due to their\nlimited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA\nbenchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound\nqueries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query\nexpansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent\nproposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover\nmore relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and\ncomputing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master\nmultiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information\nunderstanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a\npre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved\ndocuments, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high\nretrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that\neven a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query\nexpansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks.\nTo be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average\nimprovement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains\non multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented reasoning (RAR) is a recent evolution of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that employs multiple reasoning steps for\nretrieval and generation. While effective for some complex queries, RAR remains\nvulnerable to errors and misleading outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)\noffers methods to estimate the confidence of systems' outputs. These methods,\nhowever, often handle simple queries with no retrieval or single-step\nretrieval, without properly handling RAR setup. Accurate estimation of UQ for\nRAR requires accounting for all sources of uncertainty, including those arising\nfrom retrieval and generation. In this paper, we account for all these sources\nand introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Consistency (R2C)--a novel UQ\nmethod for RAR. The core idea of R2C is to perturb the multi-step reasoning\nprocess by applying various actions to reasoning steps. These perturbations\nalter the retriever's input, which shifts its output and consequently modifies\nthe generator's input at the next step. Through this iterative feedback loop,\nthe retriever and generator continuously reshape one another's inputs, enabling\nus to capture uncertainty arising from both components. Experiments on five\npopular RAR systems across diverse QA datasets show that R2C improves AUROC by\nover 5% on average compared to the state-of-the-art UQ baselines. Extrinsic\nevaluations using R2C as an external signal further confirm its effectiveness\nfor two downstream tasks: in Abstention, it achieves ~5% gains in both\nF1Abstain and AccAbstain; in Model Selection, it improves the exact match by\n~7% over single models and ~3% over selection methods.",

This method provides numerous benefits,\nincluding fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed\nto zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training\nin such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information\nretrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text\ninstance is \"similar\" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label\nis determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art\nsentence encoders.

We expand upon\nprevious literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and\nevaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based\nclassification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the\nsemantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,\nand label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic\nmulti-label text classification (MLTC) datasets.

        "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which models behavior sequence and\nnon-sequential features (e.g., user/item profiles or cross features) to infer\nuser interest, underpins industrial recommender systems. However, most methods\nface three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i)\nFeature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less\ngranular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features,\nthereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity\narises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items,\nyet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the\nentire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented\nintegration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's\neffectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle\nthe above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for\nmodeling sequential and set-wise contexts. First, we align sequence side\nfeatures with non-sequential features for accurate sequence modeling and\nfine-grained interest representation. Second, we shift the prediction paradigm\nfrom point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly\nparallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves\ndual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation,\nensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model\nsize. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer\nsuccessfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the\nAUC metric, and enhances online business metrics like CTR/RPM by 1.99%/2.46%.\nAdditionally, HoMer saves 27% of GPU resources via preliminary engineering\noptimization, further validating its superiority and practicality.",

        "abstract": "Query-service relevance prediction in e-commerce search systems faces strict\nlatency requirements that prevent the direct application of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage reasoning\ndistillation framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a powerful\nteacher LLM to a lightweight, deployment-friendly student model. In the first\nstage, we address the limitations of general-purpose LLMs by constructing a\ndomain-adapted teacher model. This is achieved through a three-step process:\ndomain-adaptive pre-training to inject platform knowledge, supervised\nfine-tuning to elicit reasoning skills, and preference optimization with a\nmulti-dimensional reward model to ensure the generation of reliable and\npreference-aligned reasoning paths. This teacher can then automatically\nannotate massive query-service pairs from search logs with both relevance\nlabels and reasoning chains. In the second stage, to address the challenges of\narchitectural heterogeneity in standard distillation, we introduce Contrastive\nReasoning Self-Distillation (CRSD). By modeling the behavior of the same\nstudent model under \"standard\" and \"reasoning-augmented\" inputs as a\nteacher-student relationship, CRSD enables the lightweight model to internalize\nthe teacher's complex decision-making mechanisms without needing the explicit\nreasoning path at inference. Offline evaluations and online A/B testing in the\nMeituan search advertising system demonstrate that our framework achieves\nsignificant improvements across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness\nand practical value.",

While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle\nwith large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent\nadvances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures,\nenabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.\nHowever, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and\ncostly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs\nwith incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In\nthis paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose\nLinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient\nframework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage\nretrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical\ngraph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic\nlinking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph\nconstruction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token\nconsumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original\npassages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant\nentity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage\nretrieval through global importance aggregation.

Evaluations of artificial intelligence\n(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how\nmodels play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new\nparadigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a\nformalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale\ndataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare\nevaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of\npeople and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative\nqueries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These\nqueries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI\nevaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to\nquantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to\npeople in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.\nHowever, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to\ngame-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more\n\"jaggedness\" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater\ndifficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning\nmodels show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing\nqueries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational\nmeta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.",

        "abstract": "Reranking, as the final stage of recommender systems, demands real-time\ninference, accuracy, and diversity. It plays a crucial role in determining the\nfinal exposure, directly influencing user experience. Recently, generative\nreranking has gained increasing attention for its strong ability to model\ncomplex dependencies among items. However, most existing methods suffer from\nthe \"likelihood trap\", where high-likelihood sequences are often perceived as\nlow-quality by humans. These models tend to repeatedly recommend a set of\nhigh-frequency items, resulting in list homogeneity, thereby limiting user\nengagement. In this work, we propose Consistent Graph-structured Generative\nRecommendation (Congrats), a novel generative reranking framework. To break the\nlikelihood trap, we introduce a novel graph-structured decoder that can capture\ndiverse sequences along multiple paths. This design not only expands the\ndecoding space to promote diversity, but also improves prediction accuracy by\nimplicit item dependencies derived from vertex transitions. Furthermore, we\ndesign a differentiable cascade system that incorporates an evaluator, enabling\nthe model to learn directly from user preferences as the training objective.\nExtensive offline experiments validate the superior performance of Congrats\nover state-of-the-art reranking methods. Moreover, Congrats has been evaluated\non a large-scale video-sharing app, Kuaishou, with over 300 million daily\nactive users, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves both\nrecommendation quality and diversity, validating our effectiveness in practical\nindustrial environments.",

However, it is not well-explored how to best\nrepresent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,\nparticularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a\nnovel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a\nGitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each\nhierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a\nknowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using\nRAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the\ngenerated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable\nacross both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the\nretriever, a significant gain in efficiency.

While models display impressive accuracy on factual\nquestion-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex\nqueries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,\nwe introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a\ncontrolled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual\nquestions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex\nqueries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic\nmisalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further\nuncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive\ncorrect or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through\nmechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model\ninternals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict\nshort-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes\nfactual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'\ntrustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly\nassume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in\nmore complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), owing to their extensive open-domain knowledge\nand semantic reasoning capabilities, have been increasingly integrated into\nrecommender systems (RS). However, a substantial gap remains between the\npre-training objectives of LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation\ntasks. To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed\non specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their\npredictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it\ninduces Language Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens-such\nas task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens-while underutilizing core user\ninteraction tokens that encode user-specific preferences. This bias not only\nundermines recommendation accuracy but also raises unfairness concerns.\n  To address this issue, we propose Group Distributionally Robust\nOptimization-based Tuning (GDRT), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that enforces\nconsistent model performance across token groups with varying degrees of\nrelevance to auxiliary tokens. By adaptively upweighting underperforming\ngroups, typically those weakly correlated with auxiliary tokens, GDRT shifts\nthe model's attention from superficial auxiliary cues to informative user\ninteraction tokens, thereby mitigating language bias. Extensive experiments\nconducted on three public datasets demonstrate that GDRT effectively mitigates\nlanguage bias, yielding substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy\n(with an average NDCG@10 gain of 24.29%) and significantly enhancing\nrecommendation fairness.",

Additionally,\nwe introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across\nsteps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon\ntasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\\% improvement over\nSearch-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These\nresults indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for\nmore interactive and scalable web agents.",

        "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) models often capture user preferences based on\nthe historically interacted item IDs, which usually obtain sub-optimal\nperformance when the interaction history is limited. Content-based sequential\nrecommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits\nitems' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning. However,\nthere are still three key challenges: (i) how to reduce the semantic gap\nbetween different content modality representations; (ii) how to jointly model\nuser behavior preferences and content preferences; and (iii) how to design an\neffective training strategy to align ID representations and content\nrepresentations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model,\nself-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment,\nnamed SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and\ndevelop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality\nrepresentations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential\nmodel, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior\npreferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content\npreferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic\nrelationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a\ntwo-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to\nalign modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the\ntraining process of content modality dependency and item collaborative\ndependency. Extensive experiments conducted on four public video streaming\ndatasets demonstrate our SICSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art ID-modality\nsequential recommenders and content-modality sequential recommenders by 8.04%\non NDCG@5 and 6.62% on NDCD@10 on average, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Improving the long-term user welfare (e.g., sustained user engagement) has\nbecome a central objective of recommender systems (RS). In real-world\nplatforms, the creation behaviors of content creators plays a crucial role in\nshaping long-term welfare beyond short-term recommendation accuracy, making the\neffective steering of creator behavior essential to foster a healthier RS\necosystem. Existing works typically rely on re-ranking algorithms that\nheuristically adjust item exposure to steer creators' behavior. However, when\nembedded within recommendation pipelines, such a strategy often conflicts with\nthe short-term objective of improving recommendation accuracy, leading to\nperformance degradation and suboptimal long-term welfare. The well-established\neconomics studies offer us valuable insights for an alternative approach\nwithout relying on recommendation algorithmic design: revealing information\nfrom an information-rich party (sender) to a less-informed party (receiver) can\neffectively change the receiver's beliefs and steer their behavior. Inspired by\nthis idea, we propose an information-revealing framework, named Long-term\nWelfare Optimization via Information Revelation (LoRe). In this framework, we\nutilize a classical information revelation method (i.e., Bayesian persuasion)\nto map the stakeholders in RS, treating the platform as the sender and creators\nas the receivers. To address the challenge posed by the unrealistic assumption\nof traditional economic methods, we formulate the process of information\nrevelation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a learning algorithm\ntrained and inferred in environments with boundedly rational creators.\nExtensive experiments on two real-world RS datasets demonstrate that our method\ncan effectively outperform existing fair re-ranking methods and information\nrevealing strategies in improving long-term user welfare.",

Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level\nperformance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates\nthese methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is\nstill largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis\nof benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be\neliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem\nwith the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose\nEssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and\nattribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach\nyields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and\nmarkedly higher efficiency.

Through\nanalysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm\nthat latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve\nas a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a\nLanguage-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb.

This\nsuggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm\nfor enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of\nGRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on\nits representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource\nvisual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining\nbefore CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding\ncapabilities.

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial approach for\nenhancing the responses of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge\nsources. Despite the impressive performance in complex question-answering\ntasks, RAG still struggles with hallucinations. Attributing RAG-generated\ncontent through in-line citations has demonstrated potential in reducing\nhallucinations and facilitating human verification. Existing citation\ngeneration methods primarily rely on either fine-tuning the generator or\nemploying post-processing approaches for citation matching. However, the former\napproach demands substantial annotated data and computational resources, while\nthe latter often encounters difficulties in managing multiple citations and\nfrequently produces suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nframework, called VeriCite, designed to rigorously validate supporting evidence\nand enhance answer attribution. Specifically, VeriCite breaks down into a\nthree-stage generation: 1) The initial answer generation first generates a\nresponse based on all available contexts and has its claims verified through\nthe NLI model; 2) the supporting evidence selection assesses the utility of\neach document and extracts useful supporting evidences; 3) the final answer\nrefinement integrates the initial response and collected evidences to produce\nthe final, refined answer.We conduct experiments across five open-source LLMs\nand four datasets, demonstrating that VeriCite can significantly improve\ncitation quality while maintaining the correctness of the answers.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks\nsuch as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on\ntextual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for\nreadability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable\nreward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with\nstronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose\nDocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their\nstructure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired\ndocuments, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-\nand low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure\nand style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,\nand in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the\nBradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict\nthe annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a\ntest dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human\nevaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6\nand 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over\nbaselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward\nachieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%\nwin rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward\nproducing human-preferred documents.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a surge of research on leveraging large language\nmodels (LLMs) for sequential recommendation. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable\npotential in inferring users' nuanced preferences through fine-grained semantic\nreasoning. However, they also exhibit a notable limitation in effectively\nmodeling collaborative signals, i.e., behavioral correlations inherent in\nusers' historical interactions. Our empirical analysis further reveals that the\nattention mechanisms in LLMs tend to disproportionately focus on tokens within\nthe same item, thereby impeding the capture of cross-item correlations.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a novel hierarchical attention masking\nstrategy for LLM-based recommendation, termed HatLLM. Specifically, in shallow\nlayers, HatLLM masks attention between tokens from different items,\nfacilitating intra-item semantic understanding; in contrast, in deep layers,\nHatLLM masks attention within items, thereby compelling the model to capture\ncross-item correlations. This progressive, layer-wise approach enables LLMs to\njointly model both token-level and item-level dependencies. Extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HatLLM achieves\nsignificant performance gains (9.13% on average) over existing LLM-based\nmethods.",

However, recent\nstudies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a\nmismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this\nissue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis\nstrategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create\ndata tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.\nSpecifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a\nquery-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher\nresponse quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned\nprompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate\nthen Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for\nthe entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive\nexperiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn\nconsistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in\ninstruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the\neffectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.",

This limitation\nis particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication\nmust be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To\naddress this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a\nfive-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction\n(HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures\nwith structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects\nof readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into\nparticipatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical\nvalidation.
