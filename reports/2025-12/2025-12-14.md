#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Evaluation of Merlin and Morgana models using masked language modeling and adversarial training (M/A training) at token and sentence levels on the SQuAD dataset.
- **Aim**: To assess the effectiveness of adversarial training in improving question-answering performance by analyzing masked contexts and comparing model behavior against a baseline.
- **Rationale**: Adversarial training addresses contextual biases in models, enabling better discrimination between correct answers and distractors, which is critical for robust question-answering systems.
- **Ground**: The study uses the SQuAD validation dataset and introduces visualizations (Figures 18-19) to compare pre- and post-training masked contexts, with color-coded annotations for masked tokens, correct answers, and probability thresholds.
- **Experiment**: Token- and sentence-level adversarial training strategies are applied to Merlin and Morgana models. Results are benchmarked against a baseline model using diagnostic visualizations that highlight correct/incorrect answers and model confidence.
- **Takeaway**: Adversarial training at multiple granularities (token/sentence) enhances model performance by reducing contextual biases, as demonstrated through comparative visualizations and probabilistic analysis of masked contexts.

#### Abstract
> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models rely on retrieved evidence to guide large language model (LLM) generators, yet current systems treat retrieval as a weak heuristic rather than verifiable evidence. As a result, LLMs answer without support, hallucinate under incomplete or misleading context, and rely on spurious evidence. We introduce a training framework that treats the entire RAG pipeline -- both the retriever and the generator -- as an interactive proof system via an adaptation of the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions of unkown provenance: Merlin provides helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify and modify the evidence most influential to Arthur. Consequently, Arthur learns to (i) answer when the context support the answer, (ii) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (iii) rely on the specific context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a rigorous evaluation framework to disentangle explanation fidelity from baseline predictive errors. This allows us to introduce and measure the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A certified mutual-information guarantees relative to model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Across three RAG datasets and two model families of varying sizes, M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, and reject behavior, as well as reduced hallucinations -- without needing manually annotated unanswerable questions. The retriever likewise improves recall and MRR through automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives. Our results demonstrate that autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision provides a principled and practical path toward reliable RAG systems that treat retrieved documents not as suggestions, but as verifiable evidence.

### 2. qa-FLoRA: Data-free query-adaptive Fusion of LoRAs for LLMs

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 10

- **Submitted**: 2025-12-12 08:27:34
- **Comment**: Accepted at AAAI 2026 (Main Technical Track)
- **Topic Keywords**: query, queries, relevance, rank
- **Reason**: The paper explores query-adaptive fusion of LoRAs for LLMs, which is related to query understanding and ranking models. However, the focus on large language models and adapter fusion is not directly aligned with the user's primary research interests in information retrieval and search technologies. The connection to deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization is also not explicitly mentioned in the abstract.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: qa-FLoRA: A Query-Adaptive, Data-and-Training-Free LoRA Fusion Framework for Multi-Domain Composite Tasks
- **Aim**: To address limitations of existing LoRA fusion methods (static fusion, dynamic fusion requiring retraining, and training-free approaches dependent on domain-specific data) by introducing a scalable, query-adaptive framework that dynamically computes fusion weights based on distributional divergence between base models and adapters.
- **Rationale**: Current methods for fusing LoRA modules in large language models (LLMs) either use fixed weights (static fusion), require retraining for new adapters (dynamic fusion), or depend on domain-specific data (training-free approaches). These limitations hinder scalability, adaptability, and practical deployment for multi-domain tasks.
- **Ground**: qa-FLoRA computes layer-level fusion weights using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the base model and adapters, derived from hidden state distributions projected via the LM head. This eliminates reliance on training data or parametric routing networks, enabling query-adaptive fusion without retraining. The framework operates in three stages: (1) query-adaptive fusion, (2) data-and-training-free operation, and (3) layer-level interpretability.
- **Experiment**: Evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-3-8B with nine composite tasks (mathematical reasoning, code generation, medical QA). LoRA experts were trained on diverse datasets. qa-FLoRA outperformed static fusion by ~5-6%, training-free baselines by ~7-10%, and closed the gap with supervised methods like LoRAFlow and LoRAHub.
- **Takeaway**: qa-FLoRA advances parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for LLMs by enabling scalable, interpretable fusion of domain-specific adapters without retraining. Its data-and-training-free design addresses practical deployment challenges, offering a principled approach to query-adaptive model adaptation for multi-domain tasks.

#### Abstract
> The deployment of large language models for specialized tasks often requires domain-specific parameter-efficient finetuning through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules. However, effectively fusing these adapters to handle complex, multi-domain composite queries remains a critical challenge. Existing LoRA fusion approaches either use static weights, which assign equal relevance to each participating LoRA, or require data-intensive supervised training for every possible LoRA combination to obtain respective optimal fusion weights. We propose qa-FLoRA, a novel query-adaptive data-and-training-free method for LoRA fusion that dynamically computes layer-level fusion weights by measuring distributional divergence between the base model and respective adapters. Our approach eliminates the need for composite training data or domain-representative samples, making it readily applicable to existing adapter collections. Extensive experiments across nine multilingual composite tasks spanning mathematics, coding, and medical domains, show that qa-FLoRA outperforms static fusion by ~5% with LLaMA-2 and ~6% with LLaMA-3, and the training-free baselines by ~7% with LLaMA-2 and ~10% with LLaMA-3, while significantly closing the gap with supervised baselines. Further, layer-level analysis of our fusion weights reveals interpretable fusion patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for robust multi-domain adaptation.

### 3. FAIR: Focused Attention Is All You Need for Generative Recommendation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Longtao Xiao, Haolin Zhang, Guohao Cai, Jieming Zhu, Yifan Wang, Heng Chang, Zhenhua Dong, Xiu Li, Ruixuan Li
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11254v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-12 03:25:12
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, user behavior, recommend
- **Reason**: The paper FAIR: Focused Attention Is All You Need for Generative Recommendation is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, particularly in the context of user behavior modeling and attention mechanisms. However, it primarily focuses on recommender systems, which is a secondary area of interest for you. The paper's emphasis on generative recommendation and attention noise reduction is not directly aligned with your core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Recently, transformer-based generative recommendation has garnered significant attention for user behavior modeling. However, it often requires discretizing items into multi-code representations (e.g., typically four code tokens or more), which sharply increases the length of the original item sequence. This expansion poses challenges to transformer-based models for modeling user behavior sequences with inherent noises, since they tend to overallocate attention to irrelevant or noisy context. To mitigate this issue, we propose FAIR, the first generative recommendation framework with focused attention, which enhances attention scores to relevant context while suppressing those to irrelevant ones. Specifically, we propose (1) a focused attention mechanism integrated into the standard Transformer, which learns two separate sets of Q and K attention weights and computes their difference as the final attention scores to eliminate attention noise while focusing on relevant contexts; (2) a noise-robustness objective, which encourages the model to maintain stable attention patterns under stochastic perturbations, preventing undesirable shifts toward irrelevant context due to noise; and (3) a mutual information maximization objective, which guides the model to identify contexts that are most informative for next-item prediction. We validate the effectiveness of FAIR on four public benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.

### 4. Does Less Hallucination Mean Less Creativity? An Empirical Investigation in LLMs

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Mohor Banerjee, Nadya Yuki Wangsajaya, Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff, Min Sen Tan, Zachary Choy Kit Chun, Alvin Chan Guo Wei
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11509v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-12 12:14:29
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper explores Large Language Models (LLMs) and their hallucination-reduction techniques, which is related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), a topic of interest. However, the focus on creativity and hallucination reduction is not directly aligned with the user's primary research themes in Information Retrieval (IR) and query understanding. The paper's relevance is somewhat tangential to the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning, but suffer from hallucination: the generation of factually incorrect content. While numerous methods have been developed to reduce hallucinations, their impact on creative generations remains unexplored. This gap is particularly critical for AI-assisted scientific discovery, which requires both factual accuracy and creative hypothesis generation. We investigate how three hallucination-reduction techniques: Chain of Verification (CoVe), Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), affect creativity in LLMs. Evaluating multiple model families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral) at varying scales (1B - 70B parameters) on two creativity benchmarks (NeoCoder and CS4), we find that these methods have opposing effects on divergent creativity. CoVe enhances divergent thinking, DoLa suppresses it, and RAG shows minimal impact. Our findings provide guidance for selecting appropriate hallucination-reduction methods in scientific applications, where the balance between factual accuracy and creative exploration is crucial.

### 5. Automating Historical Insight Extraction from Large-Scale Newspaper Archives via Neural Topic Modeling

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Keerthana Murugaraj, Salima Lamsiyah, Marten During, Martin Theobald
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11635v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-12 15:15:02
- **Comment**: This is a preprint of a manuscript submitted to Digital Scholarship in the Humanities (Oxford University Press). The paper is currently under peer review
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, search
- **Reason**: The paper explores neural topic modeling for historical text analysis, leveraging BERTopic to extract themes from newspaper archives. While it touches on aspects of information retrieval and NLP, its primary focus on historical discourse and text analysis makes it somewhat related to your interests, but not a central match.

#### Abstract
> Extracting coherent and human-understandable themes from large collections of unstructured historical newspaper archives presents significant challenges due to topic evolution, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) noise, and the sheer volume of text. Traditional topic-modeling methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), often fall short in capturing the complexity and dynamic nature of discourse in historical texts. To address these limitations, we employ BERTopic. This neural topic-modeling approach leverages transformerbased embeddings to extract and classify topics, which, despite its growing popularity, still remains underused in historical research. Our study focuses on articles published between 1955 and 2018, specifically examining discourse on nuclear power and nuclear safety. We analyze various topic distributions across the corpus and trace their temporal evolution to uncover long-term trends and shifts in public discourse. This enables us to more accurately explore patterns in public discourse, including the co-occurrence of themes related to nuclear power and nuclear weapons and their shifts in topic importance over time. Our study demonstrates the scalability and contextual sensitivity of BERTopic as an alternative to traditional approaches, offering richer insights into historical discourses extracted from newspaper archives. These findings contribute to historical, nuclear, and social-science research while reflecting on current limitations and proposing potential directions for future work.

- **Submitted**: 2025-12-12 10:19:27
- **Comment**: 49 pages, 31 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: queries
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and related topics, but it doesn't directly align with your core focus on Information Retrieval (IR), query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. The paper's focus on evaluating trustworthiness in language models for healthcare is an interesting application, but it doesn't seem to be directly connected to your research themes.

#### Abstract
> Integrating language models (LMs) in healthcare systems holds great promise for improving medical workflows and decision-making. However, a critical barrier to their real-world adoption is the lack of reliable evaluation of their trustworthiness, especially in multilingual healthcare settings. Existing LMs are predominantly trained in high-resource languages, making them ill-equipped to handle the complexity and diversity of healthcare queries in mid- and low-resource languages, posing significant challenges for deploying them in global healthcare contexts where linguistic diversity is key. In this work, we present CLINIC, a Comprehensive Multilingual Benchmark to evaluate the trustworthiness of language models in healthcare. CLINIC systematically benchmarks LMs across five key dimensions of trustworthiness: truthfulness, fairness, safety, robustness, and privacy, operationalized through 18 diverse tasks, spanning 15 languages (covering all the major continents), and encompassing a wide array of critical healthcare topics like disease conditions, preventive actions, diagnostic tests, treatments, surgeries, and medications. Our extensive evaluation reveals that LMs struggle with factual correctness, demonstrate bias across demographic and linguistic groups, and are susceptible to privacy breaches and adversarial attacks. By highlighting these shortcomings, CLINIC lays the foundation for enhancing the global reach and safety of LMs in healthcare across diverse languages.

### 7. Leveraging LLMs for Title and Abstract Screening for Systematic Review: A Cost-Effective Dynamic Few-Shot Learning Approach

- **Submitted**: 2025-12-12 03:51:54
- **Comment**: 22 pages, 3 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, search
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, specifically in the context of title and abstract screening for systematic reviews. However, it focuses on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, which is not a primary area of interest for you. The paper's relevance to your work on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling is limited.

#### Abstract
> Systematic reviews are a key component of evidence-based medicine, playing a critical role in synthesizing existing research evidence and guiding clinical decisions. However, with the rapid growth of research publications, conducting systematic reviews has become increasingly burdensome, with title and abstract screening being one of the most time-consuming and resource-intensive steps. To mitigate this issue, we designed a two-stage dynamic few-shot learning (DFSL) approach aimed at improving the efficiency and performance of large language models (LLMs) in the title and abstract screening task. Specifically, this approach first uses a low-cost LLM for initial screening, then re-evaluates low-confidence instances using a high-performance LLM, thereby enhancing screening performance while controlling computational costs. We evaluated this approach across 10 systematic reviews, and the results demonstrate its strong generalizability and cost-effectiveness, with potential to reduce manual screening burden and accelerate the systematic review process in practical applications.

### 8. Applying NLP to iMessages: Understanding Topic Avoidance, Responsiveness, and Sentiment

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3

- **Topic Keywords**: ctr, search
- **Reason**: This paper applies NLP to iMessage data, focusing on topic modeling, response times, reluctance scoring, and sentiment analysis. While it touches on NLP, which is a related topic, it doesn't directly align with your primary interests in IR, query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The e-commerce domain is not explicitly mentioned, but the paper's focus on messaging data and sentiment analysis might be of some interest.

#### Abstract
> What is your messaging data used for? While many users do not often think about the information companies can gather based off of their messaging platform of choice, it is nonetheless important to consider as society increasingly relies on short-form electronic communication. While most companies keep their data closely guarded, inaccessible to users or potential hackers, Apple has opened a door to their walled-garden ecosystem, providing iMessage users on Mac with one file storing all their messages and attached metadata. With knowledge of this locally stored file, the question now becomes: What can our data do for us? In the creation of our iMessage text message analyzer, we set out to answer five main research questions focusing on topic modeling, response times, reluctance scoring, and sentiment analysis. This paper uses our exploratory data to show how these questions can be answered using our analyzer and its potential in future studies on iMessage data.

### 9. Mining Legal Arguments to Study Judicial Formalism

- **Comment**: pre-print under review
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper is somewhat related to the user's interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data mining, but it focuses on legal argument mining and judicial formalism, which is not a central match for the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. The use of transformer LLMs and machine learning methods is relevant, but the application to the legal domain is not a primary focus of the user's research.

#### Abstract
> Courts must justify their decisions, but systematically analyzing judicial reasoning at scale remains difficult. This study refutes claims about formalistic judging in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) by developing automated methods to detect and classify judicial reasoning in Czech Supreme Courts' decisions using state-of-the-art natural language processing methods. We create the MADON dataset of 272 decisions from two Czech Supreme Courts with expert annotations of 9,183 paragraphs with eight argument types and holistic formalism labels for supervised training and evaluation. Using a corpus of 300k Czech court decisions, we adapt transformer LLMs for Czech legal domain by continued pretraining and experiment with methods to address dataset imbalance including asymmetric loss and class weighting. The best models successfully detect argumentative paragraphs (82.6\% macro-F1), classify traditional types of legal argument (77.5\% macro-F1), and classify decisions as formalistic/non-formalistic (83.2\% macro-F1). Our three-stage pipeline combining ModernBERT, Llama 3.1, and traditional feature-based machine learning achieves promising results for decision classification while reducing computational costs and increasing explainability. Empirically, we challenge prevailing narratives about CEE formalism. This work shows that legal argument mining enables reliable judicial philosophy classification and shows the potential of legal argument mining for other important tasks in computational legal studies. Our methodology is easily replicable across jurisdictions, and our entire pipeline, datasets, guidelines, models, and source codes are available at https://github.com/trusthlt/madon.

### 10. CIP: A Plug-and-Play Causal Prompting Framework for Mitigating Hallucinations under Long-Context Noise

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Qingsen Ma, Dianyun Wang, Ran Jing, Yujun Sun, Zhenbo Xu
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11282v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-12 05:02:26
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on mitigating hallucinations in large language models using causal prompting, which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the primary focus is on improving the reliability and efficiency of language models, which is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes. The paper does involve NLP, but it's more focused on model interpretability and stability rather than deep semantic understanding or real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Large language models often hallucinate when processing long and noisy retrieval contexts because they rely on spurious correlations rather than genuine causal relationships. We propose CIP, a lightweight and plug-and-play causal prompting framework that mitigates hallucinations at the input stage. CIP constructs a causal relation sequence among entities, actions, and events and injects it into the prompt to guide reasoning toward causally relevant evidence. Through causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning, CIP suppresses non causal reasoning paths, improving factual grounding and interpretability. Experiments across seven mainstream language models, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Llama 3.1, show that CIP consistently enhances reasoning quality and reliability, achieving 2.6 points improvement in Attributable Rate, 0.38 improvement in Causal Consistency Score, and a fourfold increase in effective information density. API level profiling further shows that CIP accelerates contextual understanding and reduces end to end response latency by up to 55.1 percent. These results suggest that causal reasoning may serve as a promising paradigm for improving the explainability, stability, and efficiency of large language models.

### 11. When Actions Teach You to Think: Reasoning-Action Synergy via Reinforcement Learning in Conversational Agents

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11277v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-12 04:44:40
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper explores the use of reinforcement learning to improve conversational agents' reasoning and action capabilities. While it touches on the topic of deep semantic understanding, its primary focus is on conversational agents and reasoning-action synergy, which is somewhat related to the user's interests in information retrieval and query understanding. However, the connection is not direct, and the paper's relevance is limited.

#### Abstract
> Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as one of the most effective ways to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. However, SFT can have difficulty generalizing when the underlying data distribution changes, even when the new data does not fall completely outside the training domain. Recent reasoning-focused models such as o1 and R1 have demonstrated consistent gains over their non-reasoning counterparts, highlighting the importance of reasoning for improved generalization and reliability. However, collecting high-quality reasoning traces for SFT remains challenging -- annotations are costly, subjective, and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable models to learn reasoning strategies directly from task outcomes. We propose a pipeline in which LLMs generate reasoning steps that guide both the invocation of tools (e.g., function calls) and the final answer generation for conversational agents. Our method employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with rewards designed around tool accuracy and answer correctness, allowing the model to iteratively refine its reasoning and actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves both the quality of reasoning and the precision of tool invocations, achieving a 1.5% relative improvement over the SFT model (trained without explicit thinking) and a 40% gain compared to the base of the vanilla Qwen3-1.7B model. These findings demonstrate the promise of unifying reasoning and action learning through RL to build more capable and generalizable conversational agents.

### 12. FIBER: A Multilingual Evaluation Resource for Factual Inference Bias

- **LLM Score**: 4

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11110v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-11 20:51:16
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper FIBER is somewhat related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, as it involves evaluating factual knowledge in language models. However, the focus on factual inference bias and multilingual evaluation resources is not directly aligned with the user's primary research themes of query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large language models are widely used across domains, yet there are concerns about their factual reliability and biases. Factual knowledge probing offers a systematic means to evaluate these aspects. Most existing benchmarks focus on single-entity facts and monolingual data. We therefore present FIBER, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating factual knowledge in single- and multi-entity settings. The dataset includes sentence completion, question-answering, and object-count prediction tasks in English, Italian, and Turkish. Using FIBER, we examine whether the prompt language induces inference bias in entity selection and how large language models perform on multi-entity versus single-entity questions. The results indicate that the language of the prompt can influence the model's generated output, particularly for entities associated with the country corresponding to that language. However, this effect varies across different topics such that 31% of the topics exhibit factual inference bias score greater than 0.5. Moreover, the level of bias differs across languages such that Turkish prompts show higher bias compared to Italian in 83% of the topics, suggesting a language-dependent pattern. Our findings also show that models face greater difficulty when handling multi-entity questions than the single-entity questions. Model performance differs across both languages and model sizes. The highest mean average precision is achieved in English, while Turkish and Italian lead to noticeably lower scores. Larger models, including Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, show consistently better performance than smaller 3B-4B models.

### 13. Multi-Intent Spoken Language Understanding: Methods, Trends, and Challenges

- **Submitted**: 2025-12-12 03:46:39
- **Topic Keywords**: search
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on spoken language understanding, which is related to query understanding and user behavior modeling in Information Retrieval. However, it primarily deals with spoken language and does not directly address search technologies, ranking models, or e-commerce applications, limiting its relevance to your core research interests.

#### Abstract
> Multi-intent spoken language understanding (SLU) involves two tasks: multiple intent detection and slot filling, which jointly handle utterances containing more than one intent. Owing to this characteristic, which closely reflects real-world applications, the task has attracted increasing research attention, and substantial progress has been achieved. However, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and systematic review of existing studies on multi-intent SLU. To this end, this paper presents a survey of recent advances in multi-intent SLU. We provide an in-depth overview of previous research from two perspectives: decoding paradigms and modeling approaches. On this basis, we further compare the performance of representative models and analyze their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and outline promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will offer valuable insights and serve as a useful reference for advancing research in multi-intent SLU.

#### Abstract
> SciLaD is a novel, large-scale dataset of scientific language constructed entirely using open-source frameworks and publicly available data sources. It comprises a curated English split containing over 10 million scientific publications and a multilingual, unfiltered TEI XML split including more than 35 million publications. We also publish the extensible pipeline for generating SciLaD. The dataset construction and processing workflow demonstrates how open-source tools can enable large-scale, scientific data curation while maintaining high data quality. Finally, we pre-train a RoBERTa model on our dataset and evaluate it across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, achieving performance comparable to other scientific language models of similar size, validating the quality and utility of SciLaD. We publish the dataset and evaluation pipeline to promote reproducibility, transparency, and further research in natural scientific language processing and understanding including scholarly document processing.

### 15. HFS: Holistic Query-Aware Frame Selection for Efficient Video Reasoning

- **LLM Score**: 2
- **Keyword Score**: 8
- **Authors**: Yiqing Yang, Kin-Man Lam
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11534v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-12 13:10:30
- **Comment**: 18 pages, 8 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: query, relevance, rag
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on video understanding and key frame selection, which is not directly related to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. While it involves a Small Language Model and query vectors, the context is specific to video reasoning and does not align with the user's interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Key frame selection in video understanding presents significant challenges. Traditional top-K selection methods, which score frames independently, often fail to optimize the selection as a whole. This independent scoring frequently results in selecting frames that are temporally clustered and visually redundant. Additionally, training lightweight selectors using pseudo labels generated offline by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the supervisory signal from dynamically adapting to task objectives. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework for frame selection. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to enable dynamic frame scoring. We further define a continuous set-level objective function that incorporates relevance, coverage, and redundancy, enabling differentiable optimization via Gumbel-Softmax to select optimal frame combinations at the set level. Finally, student-teacher mutual learning is employed, where the student selector (SLM) and teacher reasoner (MLLM) are trained to align their frame importance distributions via KL divergence. Combined with cross-entropy loss, this enables end-to-end optimization, eliminating reliance on static pseudo labels. Experiments across various benchmarks, including Video-MME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and NExT-QA, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

#### Abstract
> Satellite imagery differs fundamentally from natural images: its aerial viewpoint, very high resolution, diverse scale variations, and abundance of small objects demand both region-level spatial reasoning and holistic scene understanding. Current remote-sensing approaches remain fragmented between dual-encoder retrieval models, which excel at large-scale cross-modal search but cannot interleave modalities, and generative assistants, which support region-level interpretation but lack scalable retrieval capabilities. We propose $\textbf{VLM2GeoVec}$, an instruction-following, single-encoder vision-language model trained contrastively to embed interleaved inputs (images, text, bounding boxes, and geographic coordinates) in a unified vector space. Our single encoder interleaves all inputs into one joint embedding trained with a contrastive loss, eliminating multi-stage pipelines and task-specific modules. To evaluate its versatility, we introduce $\textbf{RSMEB}$, a novel benchmark covering key remote-sensing embedding applications: scene classification; cross-modal search; compositional retrieval; visual-question answering; visual grounding and region-level reasoning; and semantic geospatial retrieval. On RSMEB, it achieves $\textbf{26.6%}$ P@1 on region-caption retrieval (+25 pp vs. dual-encoder baselines), $\textbf{32.5%}$ P@1 on referring-expression retrieval (+19 pp), and $\textbf{17.8%}$ P@1 on semantic geo-localization retrieval (over $3\times$ prior best), while matching or exceeding specialized baselines on conventional tasks such as scene classification and cross-modal retrieval. VLM2GeoVec unifies scalable retrieval with region-level spatial reasoning, enabling cohesive multimodal analysis in remote sensing. We will publicly release the code, checkpoints, and data upon acceptance.

#### Abstract
> While voice-based AI systems have achieved remarkable generative capabilities, their interactions often feel conversationally broken. This paper examines the interactional friction that emerges in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) pipelines. By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity. We conclude that building natural spoken AI is an infrastructure design challenge, requiring a shift from optimizing isolated components to carefully choreographing the seams between them.

While it involves memory organization and retrieval, which are related to semantic understanding, the context is not directly aligned with information retrieval, search technologies, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Model agents face fundamental challenges in adapting to novel tasks due to limitations in tool availability and experience reuse. Existing approaches either rely on predefined tools with limited coverage or build tools from scratch without leveraging past experiences, leading to inefficient exploration and suboptimal performance. We introduce SMITH (Shared Memory Integrated Tool Hub), a unified cognitive architecture that seamlessly integrates dynamic tool creation with cross-task experience sharing through hierarchical memory organization. SMITH organizes agent memory into procedural, semantic, and episodic components, enabling systematic capability expansion while preserving successful execution patterns. Our approach formalizes tool creation as iterative code generation within controlled sandbox environments and experience sharing through episodic memory retrieval with semantic similarity matching. We further propose a curriculum learning strategy based on agent-ensemble difficulty re-estimation. Extensive experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate SMITH's effectiveness, achieving 81.8% Pass@1 accuracy and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines including Alita (75.2%) and Memento (70.9%). Our work establishes a foundation for building truly adaptive agents that continuously evolve their capabilities through principled integration of tool creation and experience accumulation.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on efficient large language model inference, proposing a framework for sublinear memory growth. While it touches on retrieval tests, the primary focus is on memory-constrained deployment of long-context LLMs, which is not directly related to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval and Search technologies.

#### Abstract
> We present Adaptive Soft Rolling KV Freeze with Entropy-Guided Recovery (ASR-KF-EGR), a training-free inference-time framework for efficient large language model generation. Our method introduces a reversible soft-freeze mechanism that temporarily suspends key-value (KV) updates for low-importance tokens identified within a sliding attention window. Unlike eviction-based approaches that permanently discard context, ASR-KF-EGR preserves all tokens in off-GPU storage and restores them on demand. We extend the framework with sublinear freeze scheduling, where freeze duration grows sublinearly with repeated low-importance detections, preventing over-aggressive compression. Preliminary experiments on LLaMA-3 8B demonstrate 55-67% reduction in active KV cache size while maintaining generation quality and passing needle-in-haystack retrieval tests. The method is architecture-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and provides a practical solution for memory-constrained deployment of long-context LLMs.

While it involves NLP, it is specific to the medical domain and does not address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> We present a new Hebrew medical language model designed to extract structured clinical timelines from electronic health records, enabling the construction of patient journeys. Our model is based on DictaBERT 2.0 and continually pre-trained on over five million de-identified hospital records. To evaluate its effectiveness, we introduce two new datasets -- one from internal medicine and emergency departments, and another from oncology -- annotated for event temporal relations. Our results show that our model achieves strong performance on both datasets. We also find that vocabulary adaptation improves token efficiency and that de-identification does not compromise downstream performance, supporting privacy-conscious model development. The model is made available for research use under ethical restrictions.

- **Reason**: This paper is not directly related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or Natural Language Processing. While it involves multilingual embeddings and machine translation, the focus is on extending a dataset for multimodal machine translation, which is not a central match to your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Multi30k is frequently cited in the multimodal machine translation (MMT) literature, offering parallel text data for training and fine-tuning deep learning models. However, it is limited to four languages: Czech, English, French, and German. This restriction has led many researchers to focus their investigations only on these languages. As a result, MMT research on diverse languages has been stalled because the official Multi30k dataset only represents European languages in Latin scripts. Previous efforts to extend Multi30k exist, but the list of supported languages, represented language families, and scripts is still very short. To address these issues, we propose MultiScript30k, a new Multi30k dataset extension for global languages in various scripts, created by translating the English version of Multi30k (Multi30k-En) using NLLB200-3.3B. The dataset consists of over \(30000\) sentences and provides translations of all sentences in Multi30k-En into Ar, Es, Uk, Zh\_Hans and Zh\_Hant. Similarity analysis shows that Multi30k extension consistently achieves greater than \(0.8\) cosine similarity and symmetric KL divergence less than \(0.000251\) for all languages supported except Zh\_Hant which is comparable to the previous Multi30k extensions ArEnMulti30k and Multi30k-Uk. COMETKiwi scores reveal mixed assessments of MultiScript30k as a translation of Multi30k-En in comparison to the related work. ArEnMulti30k scores nearly equal MultiScript30k-Ar, but Multi30k-Uk scores $6.4\%$ greater than MultiScript30k-Uk per split.

- **Reason**: This paper is not relevant to your research interests as it focuses on speculative decoding in large language models, which is a topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While it involves parallelism and optimization, it does not relate to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding, which are your primary areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> Speculative generation has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate inference in large language models (LLMs) by leveraging parallelism to verify multiple draft tokens simultaneously. However, the fundamental limits on the achievable speedup remain poorly understood. In this work, we establish the first ``tight'' lower bounds on the runtime of any deterministic speculative generation algorithm. This is achieved by drawing a parallel between the token generation process and branching random walks, which allows us to analyze the optimal draft tree selection problem. We prove, under basic assumptions, that the expected number of tokens successfully predicted per speculative iteration is bounded as $\mathbb{E}[X] \leq (μ+ μ_{(2)})\log(P )/μ^2 + O(1)$, where $P$ is the verifier's capacity, $μ$ is the expected entropy of the verifier's output distribution, and $μ_{(2)}$ is the expected second log-moment. This result provides new insights into the limits of parallel token generation, and could guide the design of future speculative decoding systems. Empirical evaluations on Llama models validate our theoretical predictions, confirming the tightness of our bounds in practical settings.

- **Reason**: This paper is not directly related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. Although it involves machine learning and deep learning techniques, the focus is on molecular toxicity prediction and chemical language models, which is outside your primary areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> Reliable in silico molecular toxicity prediction is a cornerstone of modern drug discovery, offering a scalable alternative to experimental screening. However, the black-box nature of state-of-the-art models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as high-stakes safety decisions demand verifiable structural insights alongside predictive performance. To address this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework designed to jointly enhance accuracy and interpretability. Our architecture integrates a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. By imposing an L1 sparsity penalty on these modules, the framework is constrained to focus on a minimal set of salient molecular fragments for each distinct toxicity endpoint. The resulting framework is trained end-to-end and is readily adaptable to various transformer-based backbones. Evaluated on the ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 benchmark datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both single-task and standard MTL baselines. Crucially, the sparse attention weights provide chemically intuitive visualizations that reveal the specific fragments influencing predictions, thereby enhancing insight into the model's decision-making process.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on efficient language model inference, proposing a novel decoding scheme called AdaSD. While it touches on aspects of NLP, it does not directly relate to information retrieval, query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of your research interests.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, but their increasing parameter sizes significantly slow down inference. Speculative decoding mitigates this issue by leveraging a smaller draft model to predict candidate tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, existing approaches often require additional training, extensive hyperparameter tuning, or prior analysis of models and tasks before deployment. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Speculative Decoding (AdaSD), a hyperparameter-free decoding scheme that dynamically adjusts generation length and acceptance criteria during inference. AdaSD introduces two adaptive thresholds: one to determine when to stop candidate token generation and another to decide token acceptance, both updated in real time based on token entropy and Jensen-Shannon distance. This approach eliminates the need for pre-analysis or fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf models. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaSD achieves up to 49\% speedup over standard speculative decoding while limiting accuracy degradation to under 2\%, making it a practical solution for efficient and adaptive LLM inference.

#### Abstract
> This paper introduces LegalRikai: Open Benchmark, a new benchmark comprising four complex tasks that emulate Japanese corporate legal practices. The benchmark was created by legal professionals under the supervision of an attorney. This benchmark has 100 samples that require long-form, structured outputs, and we evaluated them against multiple practical criteria. We conducted both human and automated evaluations using leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.1. Our human evaluation revealed that abstract instructions prompted unnecessary modifications, highlighting model weaknesses in document-level editing that were missed by conventional short-text tasks. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that automated evaluation aligns well with human judgment on criteria with clear linguistic grounding, and assessing structural consistency remains a challenge. The result demonstrates the utility of automated evaluation as a screening tool when expert availability is limited. We propose a dataset evaluation framework to promote more practice-oriented research in the legal domain.
