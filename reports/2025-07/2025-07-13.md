- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 13
- **Authors**: Zhichao Xu, Zhiqi Huang, Shengyao Zhuang, Ashim Gupta, Vivek Srikumar
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08336v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-11 06:28:35
- **Topic Keywords**: information retrieval, ranking, rerank, retrieval, recommend, rank
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to my research interests in Information Retrieval, specifically in the area of query understanding and ranking models. The comparison of contrastive learning and knowledge distillation strategies for training rerankers is directly applicable to my focus on Learning to Rank and user behavior modeling. The paper's findings on the effectiveness of knowledge distillation for training smaller rerankers are particularly useful for my work in this area.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Training Strategies for Text Rerankers
- **Aim**: Comparing the effectiveness of contrastive learning (CL) and knowledge distillation (KD) for training text rerankers
- **Rationale**: Evaluating the performance of CL and KD on rerankers of different sizes and architectures to determine the best strategy
- **Ground**: MS MARCO passage retrieval dataset, with a strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher
- **Experiment**: Controlled experiment training rerankers using CL and KD, with in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation on various benchmarks
- **Takeaway**: KD is an effective strategy for training smaller rerankers when a strong, larger teacher model is available, but its benefits may diminish when the student capacity approaches or matches the teacher's

#### Abstract
> Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Temporal Drift in Information Retrieval Systems
- **Aim**: Addressing the phenomenon of temporal drift in IR models
- **Rationale**: Evaluating IR systems across temporally distributed web snapshots
- **Ground**: The Qwant web dataset with 18 million documents and 9,000 training queries
- **Experiment**: A two-phase retrieval system with sparse keyword searches, query expansion, and document reranking
- **Takeaway**: Reranking provides the most gain in performance, and leveraging link structures between web pages can enhance retrieval performance

#### Abstract
> Information Retrieval (IR) models are often trained on static datasets,
making them vulnerable to performance degradation as web content evolves. The
DS@GT competition team participated in the Longitudinal Evaluation of Model
Performance (LongEval) lab at CLEF 2025, which evaluates IR systems across
temporally distributed web snapshots. Our analysis of the Qwant web dataset
includes exploratory data analysis with topic modeling over time. The two-phase
retrieval system employs sparse keyword searches, utilizing query expansion and
document reranking. Our best system achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.296 across
the entire training and test dataset, with an overall best score of 0.395 on
2023-05. The accompanying source code for this paper is at

- **LLM Score**: 7
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Sebastian Walter, Hannah Bast
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08107v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-10 18:50:05
- **Topic Keywords**: queries, search
- **Reason**: The paper's focus on generating SPARQL queries from natural language questions or keyword queries aligns with my interest in query understanding and search technologies. The use of a large language model to explore knowledge graphs is also relevant to my research in NLP and data mining. However, the paper's primary focus on knowledge graphs and RDF queries is not directly related to my core research themes in information retrieval and ranking models.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: GRASP: A Zero-Shot Method for Generating SPARQL Queries from Natural Language Questions or Keyword Queries
- **Aim**: To develop a system that can generate SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries without fine-tuning
- **Rationale**: The need for a system that can dynamically explore knowledge graphs and generate SPARQL queries without requiring fine-tuning or prior knowledge of the graph's syntax and properties
- **Ground**: GRASP uses a large language model to explore the knowledge graph by executing SPARQL queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals, and is designed to work with any given knowledge graph
- **Experiment**: The authors evaluate GRASP on various benchmark datasets, including WebQuestionsSP, ComplexWebQuestions, QALD-7, QALD-10, SPINACH, and WikiWebQuestions, and compare its performance with few-shot and fine-tuned models
- **Takeaway**: GRASP provides a way to generate SPARQL queries from natural language questions or keyword queries without fine-tuning, and has been shown to be effective on various benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Wikidata and coming close to few-shot or fine-tuned models on Freebase

#### Abstract
> We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

### 4. CUE-RAG: Towards Accurate and Cost-Efficient Graph-Based RAG via Multi-Partite Graph and Query-Driven Iterative Retrieval

- **LLM Score**: 6
- **Keyword Score**: 14
- **Authors**: Yaodong Su, Yixiang Fang, Yingli Zhou, Quanqing Xu, Chuanhui Yang
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08445v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-11 09:36:45
- **Topic Keywords**: semantic search, query, relevance, rag, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: The paper proposes a novel approach for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using a multi-partite graph index and query-driven iterative retrieval strategy. While it's not directly related to query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling in Information Retrieval, it does involve graph-based RAG, which is a related topic. The paper's focus on semantic search and constrained graph traversal also shows some relevance to deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods in question answering (QA) tasks
- **Aim**: To improve the performance of RAG methods by addressing poor graph quality and insufficient utilization of query information
- **Rationale**: CUE-RAG integrates text chunks, knowledge units, and entities to support semantically coherent retrieval across multiple levels of granularity, and utilizes a hybrid strategy combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with lightweight NLP tools
- **Ground**: CUE-RAG consists of offline indexing and online retrieval phases, with a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy called Q-Iter that alternates between traversing knowledge units and entities
- **Experiment**: Evaluation on three multi-hop QA benchmarks (MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) using two metrics: QA performance (Accuracy and F1 score) and cost efficiency (total token expenditure and average token consumption per online query)
- **Takeaway**: CUE-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%, and provides insights into the effectiveness of various components and hyperparameters in the system

#### Abstract
> Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
performance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of
domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from
graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from
poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of
query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose
CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index
incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic
content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy
that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated
knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy
that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph
traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy
and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%.
Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM
for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency
of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.

- **LLM Score**: 6
- **Keyword Score**: 10
- **Authors**: Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, Daniel Campos, Jimmy Lin
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08191v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-10 21:58:41
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, rag, retrieval, rank, trec
- **Reason**: The paper is somewhat relevant to my research interests in Information Retrieval, specifically in the context of deep learning and neural ranking models. The focus on the TREC Deep Learning track and the use of MS MARCO datasets for passage and document ranking tasks align with my interests. However, the paper's scope is limited to a specific track and dataset, which is not directly related to my primary focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track for Ad Hoc Retrieval
- **Aim**: Evaluating deep neural ranking models for document and passage retrieval tasks
- **Rationale**: Comparing traditional and neural network-based language models for retrieval tasks
- **Ground**: MS MARCO dataset with human-annotated training labels for passage and document ranking tasks
- **Experiment**: Benchmarking document retrieval and passage retrieval tasks with full retrieval and top-100 reranking subtasks
- **Takeaway**: Deep neural ranking models with large-scale pretraining outperform traditional retrieval methods, with neural network-based language models showing better performance on passage retrieval tasks

#### Abstract
> This is the third year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years,
we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human
annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. In addition, this year we refreshed both the document and the passage
collections which also led to a nearly four times increase in the document
collection size and nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage
collection. Deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraininig
continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods this year. We also found
that single stage retrieval can achieve good performance on both tasks although
they still do not perform at par with multistage retrieval pipelines. Finally,
the increase in the collection size and the general data refresh raised some
questions about completeness of NIST judgments and the quality of the training
labels that were mapped to the new collections from the old ones which we
discuss in this report.

### 6. Towards Efficient Quantity Retrieval from Text:an Approach via Description Parsing and Weak Supervision

- **LLM Score**: 6
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Yixuan Cao, Zhengrong Chen, Chengxuan Xia, Kun Wu, Ping Luo
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08322v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-11 05:25:09
- **Comment**: Extended version of the paper accepted in DEXA 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper proposes a task of quantity retrieval, which is related to information retrieval, and uses description parsing and weak supervision, which are relevant to query understanding and ranking models. However, the focus on quantity retrieval and financial annual reports is not directly aligned with the user's primary interests in search technologies, user behavior modeling, and deep semantic understanding.

#### Abstract
> Quantitative facts are continually generated by companies and governments,
supporting data-driven decision-making. While common facts are structured, many
long-tail quantitative facts remain buried in unstructured documents, making
them difficult to access. We propose the task of Quantity Retrieval: given a
description of a quantitative fact, the system returns the relevant value and
supporting evidence. Understanding quantity semantics in context is essential
for this task. We introduce a framework based on description parsing that
converts text into structured (description, quantity) pairs for effective
retrieval. To improve learning, we construct a large paraphrase dataset using
weak supervision based on quantity co-occurrence. We evaluate our approach on a
large corpus of financial annual reports and a newly annotated quantity
description dataset. Our method significantly improves top-1 retrieval accuracy
from 30.98 percent to 64.66 percent.

### 7. Improving Korean-English Cross-Lingual Retrieval: A Data-Centric Study of Language Composition and Model Merging

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Youngjoon Jang, Junyoung Son, Taemin Lee, Seongtae Hong, Heuiseok Lim
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08480v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-11 10:44:09
- **Topic Keywords**: information retrieval, retrieval, search, korea
- **Reason**: The paper explores Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), which is related to my interests in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on language composition and model merging is not directly aligned with my primary research themes, such as query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. The paper's relevance is somewhat limited to my broader interests in NLP and data mining.

#### Abstract
> With the increasing utilization of multilingual text information,
Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) has become a crucial research area.
However, the impact of training data composition on both CLIR and Mono-Lingual
Information Retrieval (IR) performance remains under-explored. To
systematically investigate this data-centric aspect, we construct
linguistically parallel Korean-English datasets and train retrieval models with
various language combinations. Our experiments reveal that the language
composition of training data significantly influences IR performance,
exhibiting important inter-lingual correlations: CLIR performance improves with
specific language pairs, while Mono-Lingual IR performance declines. Our work
demonstrates that Model Merging can effectively mitigate this trade-off,
achieving strong CLIR results while preserving Mono-Lingual IR capabilities.
Our findings underscore the effects of linguistic configuration of training
data on both CLIR and Mono-Lingual IR, and present Model Merging as a viable
strategy to optimize performance across these tasks.

### 8. Digital gazetteers: review and prospects for place name knowledge bases

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Kalana Wijegunarathna, Kristin Stock, Christopher B. Jones
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08553v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-11 12:56:17
- **Topic Keywords**: information retrieval, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: The paper discusses digital gazetteers, which are relevant to information retrieval, particularly in geographical information retrieval systems. However, the focus is more on data representation and management, rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest in your research.

#### Abstract
> Gazetteers typically store data on place names, place types and the
associated coordinates. They play an essential role in disambiguating place
names in online geographical information retrieval systems for navigation and
mapping, detecting and disambiguating place names in text, and providing
coordinates. Currently there are many gazetteers in use derived from many
sources, with no commonly accepted standard for encoding the data. Most
gazetteers are also very limited in the extent to which they represent the
multiple facets of the named places yet they have potential to assist user
search for locations with specific physical, commercial, social or cultural
characteristics. With a view to understanding digital gazetteer technologies
and advancing their future effectiveness for information retrieval, we provide
a review of data sources, components, software and data management
technologies, data quality and volunteered data, and methods for matching
sources that refer to the same real-world places. We highlight the need for
future work on richer representation of named places, the temporal evolution of
place identity and location, and the development of more effective methods for
data integration.

### 9. xpSHACL: Explainable SHACL Validation using Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Large Language Models

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Gustavo Correa Publio, Jos√© Emilio Labra Gayo
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08432v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-11 09:18:41
- **Comment**: Accepted for publication in the 2nd LLM+Graph Workshop, colocated at
  VLDB'25
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval, acl
- **Reason**: The paper xpSHACL focuses on explainable SHACL validation, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. While it touches on language models, the primary application is in knowledge graph validation, which is not a core area of interest. The paper's relevance is somewhat tangential, but it may be of interest to those with a broader background in NLP and data mining.

#### Abstract
> Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is a powerful language for validating RDF
data. Given the recent industry attention to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), more users
need to validate linked data properly. However, traditional SHACL validation
engines often provide terse reports in English that are difficult for
non-technical users to interpret and act upon. This paper presents xpSHACL, an
explainable SHACL validation system that addresses this issue by combining
rule-based justification trees with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and
large language models (LLMs) to produce detailed, multilanguage, human-readable
explanations for constraint violations. A key feature of xpSHACL is its usage
of a Violation KG to cache and reuse explanations, improving efficiency and
consistency.

### 10. CRMAgent: A Multi-Agent LLM System for E-Commerce CRM Message Template Generation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Yinzhu Quan, Xinrui Li, Ying Chen
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08325v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-11 05:31:35
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval, commerce, e-commerce
- **Reason**: The paper introduces a system for generating message templates in e-commerce CRM, which is related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the focus is on message generation rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are the user's primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their transformative potential
across numerous disciplinary studies, reshaping the existing research
methodologies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. However, a
systematic understanding of their integration into diverse disciplines remains
underexplored. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
application of LLMs in interdisciplinary studies, categorising research efforts
from both a technical perspective and with regard to their applicability. From
a technical standpoint, key methodologies such as supervised fine-tuning,
retrieval-augmented generation, agent-based approaches, and tool-use
integration are examined, which enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of
LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their
applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various
disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the
humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific
tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising
research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By
providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and
applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource
for the researchers who are navigating the complex landscape of LLMs in the
context of interdisciplinary studies.

### 12. Audit, Alignment, and Optimization of LM-Powered Subroutines with Application to Public Comment Processing

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Reilly Raab, Mike Parker, Dan Nally, Sadie Montgomery, Anastasia Bernat, Sai Munikoti, Sameera Horawalavithana
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08109v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-10 18:52:09
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: The paper proposes a framework for leveraging language models in a transparent and auditable manner, which is related to the topic of query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on language models and their application to public comment processing is not directly aligned with the user's primary research interests in Information Retrieval, especially in areas that require deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

### 13. What Factors Affect LLMs and RLLMs in Financial Question Answering?

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 1
- **Authors**: Peng Wang, Xuesi Hu, Jiageng Wu, Yuntao Zou, Qiancheng Zhang, Dagang Li
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08339v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-11 06:37:44
- **Comment**: Preprint
- **Topic Keywords**: search
- **Reason**: The paper explores the performance of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large language models (RLLMs) in financial question answering, focusing on prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods. While it touches on the topic of language models, it does not directly relate to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding, which are core areas of interest. The paper's focus on financial question answering and multilingual performance also limits its relevance to the user's broader interests in NLP and data mining.

#### Abstract
> Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

### 14. LLaPa: A Vision-Language Model Framework for Counterfactual-Aware Procedural Planning

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08496v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-07-11 11:18:49
- **Topic Keywords**: retriever, rerank, rag, rank
- **Reason**: This paper is not directly related to Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or Natural Language Processing, which are the primary areas of interest. The focus on procedural planning, vision-language models, and counterfactual reasoning is outside the scope of the user's research themes.

#### Abstract
> While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are
available https://github.com/sunshibo1234/LLaPa.

#### Abstract
> We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

#### Abstract
> To ensure equitable access to the benefits of large language models (LLMs),
it is essential to evaluate their capabilities across the world's languages. We
introduce the AI Language Proficiency Monitor, a comprehensive multilingual
benchmark that systematically assesses LLM performance across up to 200
languages, with a particular focus on low-resource languages. Our benchmark
aggregates diverse tasks including translation, question answering, math, and
reasoning, using datasets such as FLORES+, MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA, and ARC. We
provide an open-source, auto-updating leaderboard and dashboard that supports
researchers, developers, and policymakers in identifying strengths and gaps in
model performance. In addition to ranking models, the platform offers
descriptive insights such as a global proficiency map and trends over time. By
complementing and extending prior multilingual benchmarks, our work aims to
foster transparency, inclusivity, and progress in multilingual AI. The system

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on KV cache compression for large language models, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding. While it mentions approximate leverage scores, the context is different from the user's interests in ranking models and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on using large language models for legal decision-making in Austrian Value-Added Tax Law, which is not directly related to the user's research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While the paper mentions fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation, these methods are not typically used in the context of query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest for the user.

#### Abstract
> This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Although it involves neural networks and data processing, the topic is more aligned with human-computer interaction and computer graphics, making it irrelevant to the user's primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in
response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

While the paper mentions 'steering' and 'model behavior', the context is different from the user's background in e-commerce and NLP.

#### Abstract
> We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

While it touches on language processing, it is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding, which are the user's primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> In this study, we leverage a unique UNESCO collection of mid-20th century
radio recordings to probe the robustness of modern off-the-shelf language
identification (LID) and speaker recognition (SR) methods, especially with
respect to the impact of multilingual speakers and cross-age recordings. Our
findings suggest that LID systems, such as Whisper, are increasingly adept at
handling second-language and accented speech. However, speaker embeddings
remain a fragile component of speech processing pipelines that is prone to
biases related to the channel, age, and language. Issues which will need to be
overcome should archives aim to employ SR methods for speaker indexing.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on scaling attention mechanisms for long sequences, which is not directly related to my research interests in Information Retrieval, query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling. While the paper mentions attention mechanisms, it does not specifically address query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, and its application is primarily in the NLP domain, which is not my primary focus.

#### Abstract
> Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

Although it mentions Large Language Models, the context is different from the user's interests in IR and NLP.

#### Abstract
> Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

#### Abstract
> The deep integration of large language models and automatic speech
recognition systems has become a promising research direction with high
practical value. To address the overfitting issue commonly observed in Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, this work
proposes an innovative training paradigm Iterative LoRA Training (ILT) in
combination with an Iterative Pseudo Labeling strategy, effectively enhancing
the theoretical upper bound of model performance. Based on Whisper-large-v3 and
Qwen2-Audio, we conduct systematic experiments using a three-stage training
process: Focus Training, Feed Back Training, and Fix Training. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the
MegaAIS research team applied this technique in the Interspeech 2025
Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Modeling Challenge (MLC-SLM),
achieving 4th in Track 1 (Multilingual ASR Task) and 1st place in Track 2
(Speech Separation and Recognition Task), showcasing the practical feasibility
and strong application potential of our approach.

#### Abstract
> The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

#### Abstract
> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

The paper focuses on distilling empathy from Large Language Models, which is a topic in Natural Language Processing, but it does not align with your specific interests in IR and related topics.

#### Abstract
> The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Although it mentions LLMs, the context is argument classification, which is not a primary focus of the user's research.

#### Abstract
> Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

#### Abstract
> Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

#### Abstract
> Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

- **Submitted**: 2025-07-11 01:21:21
- **Topic Keywords**: rank
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization of fungi species, using computer vision and deep learning techniques. While it explores data augmentation and sampling strategies, the topic is not related to information retrieval, search technologies, or natural language processing, which are the user's primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this
suggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted
multi-modal learning. Our code is available at

- **Topic Keywords**: search
- **Reason**: This paper is not relevant to the user's research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, query understanding, ranking models, user behavior modeling, or Natural Language Processing. The paper focuses on analyzing pain experiences using NLP, which is a different domain and does not align with the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

- **Topic Keywords**: search
- **Reason**: This paper is not directly related to Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling. While it touches on Natural Language Processing, it focuses on a specific aspect of NLP (truthfulness prediction in LLM outputs) and is not relevant to the broader topics of interest.

#### Abstract
> Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM
