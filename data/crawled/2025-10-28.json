        "abstract": "Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for\ndiscrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked\ndiffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens\nthat are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when\ndependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among\ntokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that\nintroduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through\ncontrolled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD\nsuccessfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to\ncapture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku\npuzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves\nglobal consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality\nand dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational\ninference into masked diffusion.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that\nexternalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with\nthink-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit\nstronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many\nquality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces\njudgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding\ndiluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a\ntwo-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1\nperforms adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical\ndimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,\nevidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a\ntargeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters\nmost. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn\ntraces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making\nthe approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting\nall-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,\nBR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet\nconsequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthree challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains.

        "abstract": "Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel\nat this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is\nfundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate\nfluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as\nabstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes\ninto finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This\nrecursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,\nenabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.\nFurthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,\nmulti-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical\ndecision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly\nsurpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates\nexceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that\nunifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful\nand effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

        "abstract": "Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), which couple acoustic perception with\nlarge language models (LLMs) to extract and understand diverse information from\naudio, have attracted intense interest from both academic and industrial\ncommunities. However, existing LALMs are highly sensitive to how instructions\nare phrased, affecting both (i) instruction-following rates and (ii) task\nperformance. Yet, no existing benchmarks offer a systematic and comprehensive\nevaluation of this sensitivity. We introduce ISA-Bench, a dynamic benchmark\nevaluating instruction sensitivity for LALMs along three axes: instruction\ndescription, output format, and task composition. We assess recent open-source\nand proprietary LALMs using ISA-Bench, profiling both compliance and accuracy\nunder controlled instruction variations. Experimental results reveal that even\nstate-of-the-art LALMs suffer significant instruction sensitivity, leading to\ndegraded performance on fundamental audio understanding tasks. To mitigate this\nissue, we fine-tune Qwen2-Audio on a specifically constructed complex\ninstruction-variant dataset, achieving a marked improvement in\ninstruction-following performance. However, this also induces nontrivial\ncatastrophic forgetting: the model loses some previously mastered task\ncapabilities when exposed to new instruction styles.

To evaluate these core intents, we\npropose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized\nQuestion Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized\nintents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer\nselection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting\ntheir acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains\nthrough systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality\ncontrol combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental\nevaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems\nstruggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts.

To address the above\nchallenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward\nmodeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:\nWe introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form\npreferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,\nvideo, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal\npreference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K\ninstruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We\npropose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative\nRMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other\nwidely used reward modeling benchmarks.",

We introduce a dual methodological\napproach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms\nderived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating\nin a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we\ncompare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of\nagreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method\nconsistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings\nhighlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting\nreligious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language\nshould be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning.

This paper introduces a\nbenchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate\nchanges in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing\nresearch has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,\nand emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for\nforward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary\ndatasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United\nStates, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI\nadoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal\nsplits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using\nmultiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and\nhybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy\nand qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task\nprompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer\nadvantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly\nacross sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting\nand rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to\nsupport future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based\neconomic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how\nLLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible\ntestbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool\nin the context of labor markets.",

        "abstract": "Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on\ntime-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure\nthe human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an\nassistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but\nalso estimate how and when this information can be communicated most\neffectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive\nresource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming\ninformation. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which\nmeets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,\nformalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)\nmodelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely\nalignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts\nmessage specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based\non projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence\nattention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several\ntimesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show\nthat this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with\na realistic model of user awareness.

        "abstract": "Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA,\noptimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and\ncultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic\nsources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a\nproprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works\nin linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside\nthousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned\nthrough a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the\nmeaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across\nclassical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on\ncomprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant\nresponses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that\noften fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen\nuses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its\ncore innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the\n\"Utility Gap Crisis\" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users'\ncore needs, forcing them into frustrating cycles of re-prompting. By\nprioritizing clarity and decisive guidance, Mubeen transforms from an\ninformation repository into a decisive guide, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030.\nThe model's architecture combines deep heritage specialization with\nmulti-disciplinary expert modules, enabling robust performance across both\ncultural preservation and general knowledge domains.",

        "abstract": "The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new\npossibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among\nthese, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to\nidentify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting\nprecise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting\nexample-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images\n(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of\ncapturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To\novercome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that\nunifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide\nembeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a\ncorpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained\nmorphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and\nflexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)\nmosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide\nresearch; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly\nretrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public\npathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including\nanatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,\nand grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and\nstomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional\nimage-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further\ndemonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,\nand enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical\nscenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable\nretrieval solution for digital pathology.",

Existing hallucination detection\nmethods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust\ngeneralization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach:\na sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language\ntask. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,\nconditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on\nMIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM\noutperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance,\nrelative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in\nAUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods\nreliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to\nan unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively\nfilter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when\ndiscarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted\nbest-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative\nimprovements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for\nBERTScore.

While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end\ngeneration approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue\nthis failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two\ndisparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format\nadherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to\nspecialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in\nimplementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We\naddress this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs\nexisting screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages\nthese inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.\nBlind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%\nwin rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of\nhuman-level performance.

        "title": "Beyond Higher Rank: Token-wise Input-Output Projections for Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation",
        "abstract": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method\nwidely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the\nprojection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the\ndimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens\nshare the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This\nlimits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent\nsemantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose\nToken-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts\nLoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise\ninput-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of\nTopLoRA can be expressed as $B\\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank\nmatrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated\nfrom each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA\nweights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA\nweights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments\nacross multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently\noutperforms LoRA and its variants.

To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel\nMulti-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical\ntime-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four\nspecialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys\ndataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and\nseries-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that\nembed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial\nautocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined\nwith raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment\nmodule to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM\nand projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse\ndatasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based\nmethods.

With the rapid development of large language\nmodels (LLMs), recent research has explored leveraging the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs to enhance rating prediction tasks. However, existing\ndistillation-based methods suffer from limitations such as the teacher model's\ninsufficient recommendation capability, costly and static supervision, and\nsuperficial transfer of reasoning ability. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes RecZero, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based recommendation paradigm\nthat abandons the traditional multi-model and multi-stage distillation\napproach. Instead, RecZero trains a single LLM through pure RL to autonomously\ndevelop reasoning capabilities for rating prediction. RecZero consists of two\nkey components: (1) \"Think-before-Recommendation\" prompt construction, which\nemploys a structured reasoning template to guide the model in step-wise\nanalysis of user interests, item features, and user-item compatibility; and (2)\nrule-based reward modeling, which adopts group relative policy optimization\n(GRPO) to compute rewards for reasoning trajectories and optimize the LLM.\nAdditionally, the paper explores a hybrid paradigm, RecOne, which combines\nsupervised fine-tuning with RL, initializing the model with cold-start\nreasoning samples and further optimizing it with RL. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that RecZero and RecOne significantly outperform existing baseline\nmethods on multiple benchmark datasets, validating the superiority of the RL\nparadigm in achieving autonomous reasoning-enhanced recommender systems.",

Such characteristics pose major challenges for automated information\nextraction, especially when relying on end to end large Vision Language Models,\nwhich are computationally expensive, sensitive to noise, and slow when applied\nto files with hundreds of pages.\n  We propose a multistage pipeline that leverages traditional image processing\nmodels and OCR extraction, together with compact VLMs for structured field\nextraction of large-scale financial documents. Our approach begins with image\npre-processing, including segmentation, orientation detection, and size\nnormalization. Multilingual OCR is then applied to recover page-level text.\nUpon analyzing the text information, pages are retrieved for coherent sections.\nFinally, compact VLMs are operated within these narrowed-down scopes to extract\nstructured financial indicators.\n  Our approach is evaluated using an internal corpus of multi-lingual, scanned\nfinancial documents.

        "abstract": "Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that\nperfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on\nevaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these\nevaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the\ndifficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same\ncategory, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human\nevaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,\nmulti-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an\nobject-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely\nwith human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source\ntext-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.\nAdditionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text\nalignment.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,\ngeneral-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic\nclassroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on\nsentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,\ninterpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword\ntokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings\nunder a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our\nresults demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and\neven super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and\nsurpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis\nof annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better\naligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to\nlesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the\nsufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external\nvalidity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added\nmeasures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.\nHowever, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that\nwhile the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full\ngeneralization.

Yet scalable methods for\nevaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks\nsuch as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a\nsingle model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,\nreal-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible\nanswers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive\ntaxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to\nLMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that\nfurther breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a\nlarge-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial\nHivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)\nintra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar\nresponses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models\nproduce strikingly similar outputs.

Across models ranging\nfrom 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable\nwith respect to the hyperparameter $\\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,\nand 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better\npreserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of\nablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed\nattributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient\nupdates.",

        "abstract": "Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to\npropose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending\nthis idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the\nragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of\ndraft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention\nmasks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations\nviolate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative\ndecoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive\ngeneration. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the\nragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization\nrequirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch\nspeculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of\noverhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences\nand dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead\nwhile preserving per-sequence speculative speedups.

        "abstract": "Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple\nlinguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge\nin neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly\nused to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are\nhighly \"entangled,\" mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and\nreasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward\nlinguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult\nto isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we\nintroduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these\ncomponents. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our\nmethod iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four\nnearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically,\nreasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG)\nbrain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We\nshow that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive\npower, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other\nlinguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions\nbeyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is\ntemporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to\nlexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing\nhierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as\ntheir predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow\nfeatures, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.",

        "abstract": "Understanding how ideas develop and flow in small-group conversations is\ncritical for analyzing collaborative learning. A key structural feature of\nthese interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes\ninto interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been\nwidely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous\nspoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.\nAt the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating\ndiscourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on\ntracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether\nexplicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in\ngroup talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in\nsynchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting\nstrategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences\nperformance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that\ncapture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.\nOur results show that providing clear conversational thread information\nimproves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of\ndownstream analysis on well-structured dialogue.
