        "abstract": "We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary\nfoundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured\ndata. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large\nstructured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint\ndistribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide\nrange of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single\nmodel. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an\nepisodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query\nsubsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,\ntraining-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large\nstructured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature\ndimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,\nmissingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified\ninterface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including\ngradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation\nmodels, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The\nsuperiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,\nregression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial\nmargins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per\ntask. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.",

        "abstract": "Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired\nand deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its\nsignificance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access\nto educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social\nexclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend\non Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although\ncertain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for\nindividuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent\nrequirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially\nfor Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions\nhave primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a\nconsiderable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,\nspecifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of\nisolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of\ncontinuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research\nrepresents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we\nintroduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,\nfocusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable\nsophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.\nAdditionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained\nResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with\nBidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\\% accuracy at\nsigner dependent mode and 77.71\\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This\ndevelopment leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL\ncommunity but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign\nlanguage.",

        "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of\nmeaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture\non a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to\nimplement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the\nmechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay\nbetween the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.\nThe following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)\nincreased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over\nall tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which\nincreased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened\nalong the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance\nconsiderably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,\nhigher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though\nthe learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.\nThese pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy\nalong the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction\nconfidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input\nmeaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match\ntokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image\nclassification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in\nfine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results\nwere based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and\nfine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.",

Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs\nwith knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.\nTo facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing\nknowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a\nknowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based\non Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that\noutperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained\nmodels with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with\ncomparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.\nTogether, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing\nconnections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,\nand the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the\nutility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding\nthat fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends.

Despite widespread global deployment,\ncurrent evaluations remain predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential\nharms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We\nintroduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in\ninstruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question\nmethodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific\nexpressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social\ncategories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. Using more\nthan 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the\ndirection of error to effectively balance model performance and bias alignment\nin both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work\npresents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs\nrespond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying\npatterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also\ncontribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do\nnot effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain\nlargely consistent across different sampling temperatures.

        "abstract": "Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading\narchitectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall,\npre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational\nefficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented\ncomputation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which\nultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose\n\\textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative\nframework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key\ninnovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE)\nmodule, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes\nwhile maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view\nuser behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user\nIDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences\nto model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward\nSystem (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive\nreward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive\noffline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's\nsuperior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online\nA/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure\nposition, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\\% item CTR,\n+2.40\\% buyer, and +3.22\\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces\noperational expenditure by 75.40\\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from\n3.26\\% to 27.32\\%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple\nsearch scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of\nmillions of PVs daily.",

Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation\nduration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)\nare analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the\nquestion of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a\ncomputational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,\nDLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to\nclassical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and\ninflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with\nlinear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures\nare powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using\ndeep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing\nthan DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend\nto provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except\nfor total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),\nand fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for\nfirst fixation duration and the total number of fixations.

The result of this modified RNN model is compared\nwith other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.\nIt is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional\nRNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has\nachieved around 91.33\\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business\ncompany or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their\ncustomers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.\nBased on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can\nevaluate its marketing strategy.",

It\nproposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable\nmechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural\nsparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of\nadapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This\nallows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to\nmatch different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,\nthe method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction\nof task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly\nimproves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the\npaper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically\nevaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data\nperturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and\nrobustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language\nunderstanding tasks.

A growing body of work illustrates the promise of\nintegrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's\ngenerality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by\nincorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized\nformulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only\nto domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the\ncontextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim\nto automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual\nintervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of\nscientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,\nadding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We\nextensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and\nPySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three\nphysical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic\nwave).

        "abstract": "We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context\nQuestion-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple\nspecialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer\ngenerators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any\nhuman intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across\ndiverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware\nqueries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses\nand feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous\nlearning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model\nupdates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,\nwe set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question\ngeneration at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release\nAraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page\nchallenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving\nworkflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the\nlong-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language\nModels (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated\nagentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.",

Speech DF Arena provides a toolkit to uniformly evaluate\ndetection systems, currently across 14 diverse datasets and attack scenarios,\nstandardized evaluation metrics and protocols for reproducibility and\ntransparency. It also includes a leaderboard to compare and rank the systems to\nhelp researchers and developers enhance their reliability and robustness. We\ninclude 14 evaluation sets, 12 state-of-the-art open-source and 3 proprietary\ndetection systems. Our study presents many systems exhibiting high EER in\nout-of-domain scenarios, highlighting the need for extensive cross-domain\nevaluation. The leaderboard is hosted on Huggingface1 and a toolkit for\nreproducing results across the listed datasets is available on GitHub.",

        "title": "IDEAlign: Comparing Large Language Models to Human Experts in Open-ended Interpretive Annotations",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,\ninterpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or\ngenerating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text\nannotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives\n(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether\nLLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is\nchallenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of\nsimilarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable\nevaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied\ntask, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing\nexpert similarity ratings via a \"pick-the-odd-one-out\" triplet judgment task,\nand (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones\n(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human\nbenchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets\n(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based\nmetrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful\nto experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with\nexpert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and\nvector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm\nfor evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing\nresponsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.",

However, effectively combining evidence from these\nheterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are\nnot inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of\nmultiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method\nfirst aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard\nrank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we\nstandardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying\nz-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two\nsources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating\nthat it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or\nsource and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.",

Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,\nancestral mythification and subjective self-realization.

This work presents the first comprehensive\nintegration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further\nintroduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates\ninput-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors\nfixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain\nadaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency.
