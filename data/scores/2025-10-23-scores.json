        "abstract": "Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models\n(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the\nLLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,\nan external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for\na query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a\nuser query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as\nuser requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the\nissue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to\nfetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,\ndescription of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the\nquery. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools\nwithin the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset\nand show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense\nretrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through\nour proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden\nto the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of\ntools without inundating its context window.",

However, existing studies often\noverlook the role of corpus complexity -- a critical factor, as recent work\nshows that both corpus size and document length strongly affect dense retrieval\nperformance. In this paper, we introduce CoRECT (Controlled Retrieval\nEvaluation of Compression Techniques), a framework for large-scale evaluation\nof embedding compression methods, supported by a newly curated dataset\ncollection. To demonstrate its utility, we benchmark eight representative types\nof compression methods. Notably, we show that non-learned compression achieves\nsubstantial index size reduction, even on up to 100M passages, with\nstatistically insignificant performance loss. However, selecting the optimal\ncompression method remains challenging, as performance varies across models.\nSuch variability highlights the necessity of CoRECT to enable consistent\ncomparison and informed selection of compression methods.

These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,\nparticularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic\nunderstanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing\nframework that \"foresees\" potential model outputs by predicting their latent\nrepresentations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus\nenabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,\nwe implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.\nEmpirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction\nfollowing, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead\nconsistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average\nperformance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art.

While the European Union provides open access to\nlegislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources\ncan be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce\nEUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs\ncurated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary\nResearch Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per\ndialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,\nand follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide\nframework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic\norganization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive\ncoverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The\nresults demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap\nbetween the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,\nestablishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive\nlegal dialogue systems.",

CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight\nencoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into\nshort discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer\nthat grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)\nPromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only\ngeneration, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure\nExecution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw\nwaveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving\noptimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style\nkernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on\ndevice personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,\noffice, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations\nwhile meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end\nto end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth\ncosts by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy\nby transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that\nEdge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated\nuncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV\nplus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision.

To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation\nby GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally\ndeployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight\nNamed Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a\npsychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.\nA modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and\nevaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,\nrecall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,\nMicrosoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and\nLlama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior\nperformance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly\noutperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%\nof documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model\noperated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a\n2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop\nvalidation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer\nmodels like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure\nsolution for PII removal from clinical notes. This \"sanitisation at the source\"\napproach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the\ncreation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while\npreserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.",

        "title": "An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA",
        "abstract": "Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language\nmodels (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle\nassessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social\ndomains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability\nremains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of\nLLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a\nfield where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.\n  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial\nand open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced\npractitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA\npractice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,\nverifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.\n  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading\ninformation. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally\nrated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence\nwas generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with\nsome models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was\nno clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight\nLLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with\nclosed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.\n  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\\\"ively in\nLCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing\nbenefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour\nintensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without\ngrounding mechanisms presents ...",

We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically\nmines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web\nscale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key\nchallenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action\nlabels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module\n(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and\nlocalizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an\naction-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click\ncoordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube\ntutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps\nautomatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by\nsupervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success\nrates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On\nAgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%.

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce XGen-Q, a domain-adapted LLM built on the Qwen-Coder architecture and\npretrained on a large-scale corpus of over one million malware samples,\nspanning both source and assembly code. XGen-Q uses a multi-stage prompt\nstrategy combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to deliver reliable\nmalware identification and detailed forensic reporting, even in the presence of\ncomplex code obfuscation. To further enhance generalization, we design a\ntraining pipeline that systematically exposes the model to diverse obfuscation\npatterns.

Can Alice prove that Bob is using\nher model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from\nthe text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an\nindependence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model\nor text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it\nthrough the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are\nmore likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob\nis using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between\nBob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training\nrun. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant\ncorrelation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the\nnull hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the\nquery setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model\ngives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of\nover 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to\n12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value\non the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational\nsetting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's\ntext overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood\nof Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by\nrepeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data.

        "abstract": "Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding\noutperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine\ntranslation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam\nsearch is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding\nis effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to\nalso be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR\ndecoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its\nderivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms\nthat of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The\nresults show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST\ntasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/mbr-for-asr",

        "abstract": "Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous\noptimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,\nrelevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by\nreinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the\nmulti-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this\npaper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization\nstrategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward\nprocess in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's\noptimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating\nbalanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several\nrepresentative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms\ngroup relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more\nbalanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation\nmodel enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,\nwhile maintaining a shorter generation length.

Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)\nperform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an\nadapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)\nfine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for\nsentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi\n(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our\nresults show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and\nCPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2\npoints over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more\neffectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with\nlarger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged\ncheckpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.\nWe further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on\nEn-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than\nmonolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs\n0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more\nreliable substrate for low-resource pairs.

To address this\nproblem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch\ninference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large\nlanguage model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's\nreasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper\nexploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception\nmodule identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of\nthe preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a\nhigh-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention\nmodule interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the\nswitch, and inserts a \"deepening prompt\" to encourage further exploration along\nthat promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the\nperformance of various large language models of different sizes.",

While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature\npresents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this\nambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as\na testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in\nmultilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model\narchitectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the\nrelative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of\nforgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following\nability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its\narchitecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers\nno clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we\nshow that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also\nfacilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.",

        "abstract": "Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities\nacross a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed\nacross tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of\nspeech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper\nproposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is\nappropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the\n\\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to\nattempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.\nWe classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these\naxes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and\ninteractive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model\nexposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its\nmethodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy\nprovides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation\nmethods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,\ninteraction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark\ndesign. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide\nfor selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.",

        "abstract": "Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text\ndetection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic\ntexts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's\nprobability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the\ntwo tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that\noverlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In\nthis work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,\ni.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the\nother, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical\ncontribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest\nperformance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the\nexisting literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that\nthe accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly\ncorrelated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,\nincluding 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text\ndetectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank\ncorrelation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that\nBinoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the\npractical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for\ngreater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research\ncommunities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we\nintroduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text\ndetection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.",

However, their reliance\non routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a\n\"quality cliff\", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This\ninflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing\nadaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to\nsignificant resource over-provisioning.\n  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms\nrigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two\nphases. First, an \\emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs\nmonolithic experts into fine-grained \"sub-experts.\" This engine employs a\npartitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to\ngroup neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.\nSecond, an \\emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity\nthrough QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve\ncomplex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments\nand managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our\nevaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over\n4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline.

While\nreinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing \"Aha\"\nmoments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for\nlong-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data\nare scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for\nadvanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis\napproach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context\ntasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large\ncollections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to\ntrace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve\nrelevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on\nKeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning\npattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K\neffectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.\nOn Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA\naccuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains.

        "abstract": "Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of\navailable tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly.\nThese task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools\nsuch as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs.\nHowever, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for\ninteracting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark\nfor evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with\nvarious real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create\nMCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually\nannotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the\nground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both\nimproving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next,\nwe explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world\npracticality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform\nsimilarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full\nadvantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's\nperformance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with\nground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning\nmodels are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but\nseriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments.\nTheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining\nthem in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task\nfor current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval\nmodels.",

        "abstract": "Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has\ngained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool\nfor adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation\nmethods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional\napproaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly\ngenerate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question\ntype in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to\noptimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further\nimprovement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this\nstudy proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question\ngeneration method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language\nmodel trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the\naccuracy of difficulty control.",
