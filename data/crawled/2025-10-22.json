        "abstract": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic\nunderstanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,\nrequiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object\ninter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,\nprevious attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in\nisolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce\nGrasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.\nEmpowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports\n(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)\nmodeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally\nachieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form\nquestions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to\nactive dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a\nmore accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more\nimportantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple\nregions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains\nthe state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5\non DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple\nprompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B\non GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms\nin-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong\ncapabilities can be easily transferred to videos.",

        "abstract": "Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the\nrisk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as\ncatastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for\nmitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns\nof two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nreinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across\nLM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,\nand arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving\ncomparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this\ndifference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a\nmixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the\nother to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which\nstems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact\nwhen learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating\nthat the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in\npractical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL\nregularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our\nresults highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately\non-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully\non-policy data.",

        "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth\nuniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise\nprediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models.",

        "abstract": "Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle\nto effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and\ncomplex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless\ninteractions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and\nutilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce\nsubstantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new\nmemory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance\nand efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of\nhuman memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,\ncognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information\nthrough lightweight compression and groups information according to their\ntopics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based\ngroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,\nlong-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that\ndecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with\nGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in\naccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API\ncalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

It features 1 trillion total parameters and\nactivates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a\ntrillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including\ntrain-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and\nbottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected\ninnovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy\nmasking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches;\n(2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget\nby dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and\n(3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic\nbottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers\nbreakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on\nHMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a\nsilver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional\nreasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the\ncommunity, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge\nreasoning capabilities.

        "abstract": "Search agents have achieved significant advancements in enabling intelligent\ninformation retrieval and decision-making within interactive environments.\nAlthough reinforcement learning has been employed to train agentic models\ncapable of more dynamic interactive retrieval, existing methods are limited by\nshallow tool-use depth and the accumulation of errors over multiple iterative\ninteractions. In this paper, we present WebSeer, a more intelligent search\nagent trained via reinforcement learning enhanced with a self-reflection\nmechanism. Specifically, we construct a large dataset annotated with reflection\npatterns and design a two-stage training framework that unifies cold start and\nreinforcement learning within the self-reflection paradigm for real-world\nweb-based environments, which enables the model to generate longer and more\nreflective tool-use trajectories. Our approach substantially extends tool-use\nchains and improves answer accuracy. Using a single 14B model, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on HotpotQA and SimpleQA, with accuracies of 72.3% and\n90.0%, respectively, and demonstrate strong generalization to\nout-of-distribution datasets.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled progress in\nagentic coding, where models autonomously reason, plan, and act within\ninteractive software development workflows. However, bridging the gap between\nstatic text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution remains a\ncore challenge. In this technical report, we present KAT-Coder, a large-scale\nagentic code model trained through a multi-stage curriculum encompassing\nMid-Term Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Fine-Tuning\n(RFT), and Reinforcement-to-Deployment Adaptation. The Mid-Term stage enhances\nreasoning, planning, and reflection capabilities through a corpus of real\nsoftware engineering data and synthetic agentic interactions. The SFT stage\nconstructs a million-sample dataset balancing twenty programming languages, ten\ndevelopment contexts, and ten task archetypes. The RFT stage introduces a novel\nmulti-ground-truth reward formulation for stable and sample-efficient policy\noptimization. Finally, the Reinforcement-to-Deployment phase adapts the model\nto production-grade IDE environments using Error-Masked SFT and Tree-Structured\nTrajectory Training. In summary, these stages enable KAT-Coder to achieve\nrobust tool-use reliability, instruction alignment, and long-context reasoning,\nforming a deployable foundation for real-world intelligent coding agents.

Using Pangram, a state-of-the-art\nAI detector, we discover that approximately 9% of newly-published articles are\neither partially or fully AI-generated. This AI use is unevenly distributed,\nappearing more frequently in smaller, local outlets, in specific topics such as\nweather and technology, and within certain ownership groups. We also analyze\n45K opinion pieces from Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street\nJournal, finding that they are 6.4 times more likely to contain AI-generated\ncontent than news articles from the same publications, with many AI-flagged\nop-eds authored by prominent public figures. Despite this prevalence, we find\nthat AI use is rarely disclosed: a manual audit of 100 AI-flagged articles\nfound only five disclosures of AI use.

        "abstract": "Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons\nare arranged topographically according to their response properties, at\nmultiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning\nmodels lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces\nthat are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of\nself-attention that turns Transformers into \"Topoformers\" with topographic\norganization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are\narranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given\nkey - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected\nlayer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate\nthe feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment\nclassification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic\norganization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately\nencourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs.\nWe then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with\na masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant\nperforms on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet\nproduces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight\nlinguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain\nresponses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment\nbetween low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and\nhuman brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for\ngreater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the\norganization of linguistic information in the human brain.",

However, leveraging transfer learning\nis computationally expensive when fine-tuning large multilingual models with\nbillions of parameters, thus creating a barrier to entry for researchers\nworking on low-resource domains such as Irish translation. Parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) bridges this gap by training on a fraction of the original\nmodel parameters, with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach introducing\nsmall, trainable adapter layers. We introduce SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA as\nsemi-supervised inference-efficient approaches that strengthen domain\nadaptation and lead to improved overall performance in NMT. We demonstrate that\nSemiAdapt can outperform full-domain fine-tuning, while most notably, SemiLoRA\ncan propel PEFT methods to match or even outperform full-model fine-tuning. We\nfurther evaluate domain-by-dataset fine-tuning and demonstrate that our\nembedding-based inference methods perform especially well on larger and noisier\ncorpora.

        "abstract": "Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large\nfoundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data\nscarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the\nreason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the\nembedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the\nmodels to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to\nprovide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on\ncode-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points\nwhere recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis\nemphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,\nwe leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to\nhighlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those\nlocations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context\nbias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby\nimproving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and\nChinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places\nmore correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.",

        "abstract": "Product search is a crucial component of modern e-commerce platforms, with\nbillions of user queries every day. In product search systems, first-stage\nretrieval should achieve high recall while ensuring efficient online\ndeployment. Sparse retrieval is particularly attractive in this context due to\nits interpretability and storage efficiency. However, sparse retrieval methods\nsuffer from severe vocabulary mismatch issues, leading to suboptimal\nperformance in product search scenarios. With their potential for semantic\nanalysis, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for mitigating\nvocabulary mismatch issues and thereby improving retrieval quality. Directly\napplying LLMs to sparse retrieval in product search exposes two key\nchallenges:(1)Queries and product titles are typically short and highly\nsusceptible to LLM-induced hallucinations, such as generating irrelevant\nexpansion terms or underweighting critical literal terms like brand names and\nmodel numbers;(2)The large vocabulary space of LLMs leads to difficulty in\ninitializing training effectively, making it challenging to learn meaningful\nsparse representations in such ultra-high-dimensional spaces.To address these\nchallenges, we propose PROSPER, a framework for PROduct search leveraging LLMs\nas SParsE Retrievers. PROSPER incorporates: (1)A literal residual network that\nalleviates hallucination in lexical expansion by reinforcing underweighted\nliteral terms through a residual compensation mechanism; and (2)A lexical\nfocusing window that facilitates effective training initialization via a\ncoarse-to-fine sparsification strategy.Extensive offline and online experiments\nshow that PROSPER significantly outperforms sparse baselines and achieves\nrecall performance comparable to advanced dense retrievers, while also\nachieving revenue increments online.",

        "abstract": "Large language models have become the latest trend in natural language\nprocessing, heavily featuring in the digital tools we use every day. However,\ntheir replies often reflect a narrow cultural viewpoint that overlooks the\ndiversity of global users. This missing capability could be referred to as\ncultural reasoning, which we define here as the capacity of a model to\nrecognise culture-specific knowledge values and social norms, and to adjust its\noutput so that it aligns with the expectations of individual users. Because\nculture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour,\ncultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI. When this capacity is\nlimited or absent, models can sustain stereotypes, ignore minority\nperspectives, erode trust, and perpetuate hate. Recent empirical studies\nstrongly suggest that current models default to Western norms when judging\nmoral dilemmas, interpreting idioms, or offering advice, and that fine-tuning\non survey data only partly reduces this tendency. The present evaluation\nmethods mainly report static accuracy scores and thus fail to capture adaptive\nreasoning in context. Although broader datasets can help, they cannot alone\nensure genuine cultural competence. Therefore, we argue that cultural reasoning\nmust be treated as a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and\nlinguistic coherence. By clarifying the concept and outlining initial\ndirections for its assessment, a foundation is laid for future systems to be\nable to respond with greater sensitivity to the complex fabric of human\nculture.",

We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks\n(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our\nresults show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across\ndatasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond\nthese quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded\ntokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when\ncombined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it\nfurther improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights\nwhy gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together,\nour findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for\ndiagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust\nhallucination detection in multimodal generation.",

The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static\nset of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While\nreinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse\nrewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with\ninefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these\ndistinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically\ncombines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation,\nMENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through\nexploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a\nteacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided\nreward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and\nstrategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL\nbaselines.",

We argue that this gap stems from\nmisaligned incentives among LLM providers, platforms, and end users, which\nmanifest as four key barriers: competitive risk, detection-tool governance,\nrobustness concerns and attribution issues. We revisit three classes of\nwatermarking through this lens. \\emph{Model watermarking} naturally aligns with\nLLM provider interests, yet faces new challenges in open-source ecosystems.\n\\emph{LLM text watermarking} offers modest provider benefit when framed solely\nas an anti-misuse tool, but can gain traction in narrowly scoped settings such\nas dataset de-contamination or user-controlled provenance. \\emph{In-context\nwatermarking} (ICW) is tailored for trusted parties, such as conference\norganizers or educators, who embed hidden watermarking instructions into\ndocuments. If a dishonest reviewer or student submits this text to an LLM, the\noutput carries a detectable watermark indicating misuse. This setup aligns\nincentives: users experience no quality loss, trusted parties gain a detection\ntool, and LLM providers remain neutral by simply following watermark\ninstructions. We advocate for a broader exploration of incentive-aligned\nmethods, with ICW as an example, in domains where trusted parties need reliable\ntools to detect misuse. More broadly, we distill design principles for\nincentive-aligned, domain-specific watermarking and outline future research\ndirections.

We investigate how\nimage resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and\ndemonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly\nimprove performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training\nand inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)\nmixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances\ncomputational constraints with performance requirements.

        "title": "From Retrieval to Generation: Unifying External and Parametric Knowledge for Medical Question Answering",
        "abstract": "Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific\nknowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs)\nwith external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge\nstored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two\ncategories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning\non externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG),\nwhich depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual\ndocuments. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while\nGAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to\nunconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine\nanswer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified\nretrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external\nand parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules:\nKnowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to\nproduce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by\nretrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively\nselects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form\nconcise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments\non five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5%\nimprovement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the\neffectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive\nreasoning.

Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries,\naccess remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static\ndirectories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and\ngeographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague\nnutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as\ntime, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems\noptimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of\nfood-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified\navailability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most\nvulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital\nilliteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we\nintroduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for\nreal-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three\ninnovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases,\ncommunity platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of\nfood resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on\ncurated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional\ncorrectness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval\npolicies to evolving user needs.

We\npresent Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework\nto systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity\nclassification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.\nUsing a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we\nconstruct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.\nOur evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint\nunderstanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear\nunimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when\njoint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label.

        "abstract": "Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving reliable and effective outputs\nfrom large language models (LLMs), but its design requires specialized\nknowledge of prompting techniques and a deep understanding of target tasks. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a novel method that adaptively selects\ntask-appropriate prompting techniques based on users' abstract task\ndescriptions and automatically generates high-quality prompts without relying\non pre-existing templates or frameworks. The proposed method constructs a\nknowledge base that associates task clusters, characterized by semantic\nsimilarity across diverse tasks, with their corresponding prompting techniques.\nWhen users input task descriptions, the system assigns them to the most\nrelevant task cluster and dynamically generates prompts by integrating\ntechniques drawn from the knowledge base. An experimental evaluation of the\nproposed method on 23 tasks from BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) demonstrates\nsuperior performance compared with standard prompts and existing automatic\nprompt-generation tools, as measured by both arithmetic and harmonic mean\nscores. This research establishes a foundation for streamlining and\nstandardizing prompt creation, enabling non-experts to effectively leverage\nLLMs.",

        "title": "Extracting Rule-based Descriptions of Attention Features in Transformers",
        "abstract": "Mechanistic interpretability strives to explain model behavior in terms of\nbottom-up primitives. The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a\nsparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only\nidentifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual\ninterpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars.\nThis paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that\nmatch token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the\nlikelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based\ndescriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While\nprior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may\nnaturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output\nfeatures, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form\n\"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form\n\"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only\nwhen the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.\nAbsence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of\nexemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or\nincomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these\ntypes of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.\nWe find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100\nskip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first\nlayer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of\ncounting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into\nrule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be\nextracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they\nrepresent.",

        "abstract": "Large language models exhibit a puzzling inconsistency: they solve complex\nproblems yet frequently fail on seemingly simpler ones. We investigate whether\nLLMs internally encode problem difficulty in a way that aligns with human\njudgment, and whether this representation tracks generalization during\nreinforcement learning post-training. We train linear probes across layers and\ntoken positions on 60 models, evaluating on mathematical and coding subsets of\nEasy2HardBench. We find that human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly\ndecodable (AMC: $\\rho \\approx 0.88$) and exhibits clear model-size scaling,\nwhereas LLM-derived difficulty is substantially weaker and scales poorly.\nSteering along the difficulty direction reveals that pushing models toward\n\"easier\" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy. During\nGRPO training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, the human-difficulty probe strengthens and\npositively correlates with test accuracy across training steps, while the\nLLM-difficulty probe degrades and negatively correlates with performance. These\nresults suggest that human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that\nRL amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates derived from model\nperformance become misaligned precisely as models improve.

        "title": "Is Multilingual LLM Watermarking Truly Multilingual? A Simple Back-Translation Solution",
        "abstract": "Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs\ntraceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite\nclaims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource\nlanguages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not\ntruly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in\nmedium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic\nclustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few\nfull-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a\nback-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost\nthrough translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust\nacross different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable\nto new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17\nlanguages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking\nacross diverse languages.",

        "title": "SimBA: Simplifying Benchmark Analysis Using Performance Matrices Alone",
        "abstract": "Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult\nto make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation\nnumbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase\nframework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk,\nwhere we conduct dataset & model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a\nrepresentative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to\npredict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three\npopular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all\nthree benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk).\nWe develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark\nusing raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25%\n(1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and\nBigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl).\nAdditionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve\nmodel ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero\nmean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers\nimprove efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether\ntheir newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark.
