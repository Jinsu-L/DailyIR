The\nDS@GT competition team participated in the Longitudinal Evaluation of Model\nPerformance (LongEval) lab at CLEF 2025, which evaluates IR systems across\ntemporally distributed web snapshots. Our analysis of the Qwant web dataset\nincludes exploratory data analysis with topic modeling over time. The two-phase\nretrieval system employs sparse keyword searches, utilizing query expansion and\ndocument reranking.

        "abstract": "Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their\nperformance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of\ndomain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\naddresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from\ngraph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from\npoor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of\nquery information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nCUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index\nincorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic\ncontent at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy\nthat reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated\nknowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy\nthat enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph\ntraversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy\nand 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%.\nRemarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM\nfor indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency\nof CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.",

        "title": "Distillation versus Contrastive Learning: How to Train Your Rerankers",
        "abstract": "Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary\nstrategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on\nground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a\nlarger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear\ncomparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under\npractical conditions is needed.\n  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of\ndifferent sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a\nstrong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our\nresults show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and\nout-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling\nfrom a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model\nsizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same\ncapacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain\ntasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy\nbased on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge\ndistillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is\naccessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more\nreliable alternative otherwise.",

This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data\ngeneration and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process\nbegins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and\nparaphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented\ndata is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity\nand relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement\nlearning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.\nThese examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its\nability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate\nstrategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the\ncapabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative\nmodels. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,\nhigh-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)\nto serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces\ncomputational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial\nattacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in\nAI systems.",

        "abstract": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very\nlarge context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in\ngeneration is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,\nwhich scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often\nthe dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput\nand increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV\ncache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked\n(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present\nCompactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses\napproximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that\nCompactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining\n1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal\ncomputational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated\ncompression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given\ncontext can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that\nCompactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV\nmemory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and\ngeneralizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and\nreal-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5\nand Llama 3.1 families.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework\nof Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting\npractice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime\ncandidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of\ntax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and\nwell-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a\nconsiderable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for\nenhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and\nreal-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the\nbest configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to\nsupport tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial\nanalyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to\nthe sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when\nproperly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and\nprovide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations\nremain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific\ndocumentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured\nbackground information.",

We\nintroduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)\nthat generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance\nthrough three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the\nagent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same\naudience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,\nretrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment\nand exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their\nsuccessful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a\nrule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable\nreferences are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently\noutperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both\naudience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.",

Previous efforts to\nenhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT\ndataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual\nabilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nfine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR\nproficiency, inspired by the concept \"Bilingual Cognitive Advantage\".\nSpecifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing\ntranslation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR\nability while learning to translate text across languages.

Our findings reveal that, without\nguidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average\nstudent at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align\nincidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but\nwhether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-\nand prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across\nsubjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation\nstrategies.

Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that\nempathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled\ninto LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a\ncomprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.\nOur approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages\ndatasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore\nseveral distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four\nunique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly\nenhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs\nfine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets\nenhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform\nthe base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our\ntargeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct\nprompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.",

It involves the automatic identification and extraction of\nargumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of\nrelationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,\nthe field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and\nextracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep\nlearning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the\nquality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the\noperation of these models in publicly available argument classification\ndatabases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse\ndatasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,\nLlama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the\nChain-of-Thoughts algorithm.

These conferences\noften rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and\ncollective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown\nsignificant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through\ncollaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,\nwe present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision\nconferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant\nagents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance\ndetection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and\nstance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,\nnegative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent\nsystem to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results\nindicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced\ndebates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also\nimprove the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and\ncoherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision\nconferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate\nthe potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group\ndecision-making processes.

        "title": "What Factors Affect LLMs and RLLMs in Financial Question Answering?",
        "abstract": "Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large\nlanguage models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many\nresearchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long\nChain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance\nof LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that\nsystematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs\nand RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various\nmethods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the\neffects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment\nmethods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:\n(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of\nLLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess\ninherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional\nmethods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced\nmultilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance\nof LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for\nRLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and\nRLLMs in the field of financial question answering.",

This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF\n2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization\n(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented\nwith multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,\nand incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models\nfor zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to\nsignificantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model\noutperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of\ndomain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach\nranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this\nsuggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted\nmulti-modal learning.

        "title": "Exploring Gender Differences in Chronic Pain Discussions on Reddit",
        "abstract": "Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and\nemotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over\nthe years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of\npain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various\nscientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of\ngender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain\nexperiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully\nclassified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute\nModel-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by\naggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic\ndifferences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally\nfocused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine\nand sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication\naffects individuals differently based on gender.",

        "abstract": "Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful\nresponses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,\nespecially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and\nmake truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM\nan open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness\nprediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing\ntoolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded\nverification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,\nTruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These\nmethods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,\nblack-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type\n(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with\nboth HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based\nmodels. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,\ncalibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible\nframework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation\nof representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and\nFactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM",
