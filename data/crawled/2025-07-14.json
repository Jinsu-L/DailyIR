        "abstract": "Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong\nperformance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,\ntheir effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and\nactive scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent\nperceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action\ndynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such\nas GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment\ninteractions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and\nlong-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset\nof over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic\nenvironments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.\nThe tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,\nobject manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a\nmulti-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level\ninstructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express\nthe agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to\nevaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key\ndimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage\nGoal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below\n20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current\nlimitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of\nEmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning\nfollowed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial\nimprovements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's\neffectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on\ntask-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by\nisolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess\nsingle-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical\nlimitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging\n(e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual\ncreation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate\nmodels under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world\ndeployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through\nSimultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes\nLRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST\nspecifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority\nallocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load\nmanagement. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance\ndegradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger\ndiscriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance\ndifferences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under\nsingle-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our\nanalysis: (1) the \"overthinking trap\" is a critical factor contributing to the\nperformance degradation; (2) the models trained with \"long2short\" technique\npreserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST,\noutperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a\ncost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects\nreal-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human\nannotation.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art\nin various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking\ndifferent LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.\nHowever, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its\neffectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of\ndedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise\ncomparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining\ncomments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved\njudge performance.",

        "abstract": "The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a\nlongstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these\ncapabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming\nsignificant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,\nsome studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance\nreasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the\nQwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,\nAMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like\nLlama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although\nQwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on\nlarge-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular\nbenchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be\nunreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully\nsynthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a\nclean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we\nshow that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while\nnoisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on\nuncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure\ntrustworthy conclusions.",

        "abstract": "Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying\ncomputational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive.\nExisting efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or\nadaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both\nsimultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework\nthat combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.\nMoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter\nefficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by\ndynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This\nallows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still\nactive at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency\nby selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core\nmechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the\nfirst recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory\nfootprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms\na new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it\nsignificantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,\nwhile delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive\nbaselines.

        "title": "Am I on the Right Track? What Can Predicted Query Performance Tell Us about the Search Behaviour of Agentic RAG",
        "abstract": "Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a new paradigm where the\nreasoning model decides when to invoke a retriever (as a \"tool\") when answering\na question. This paradigm, exemplified by recent research works such as\nSearch-R1, enables the model to decide when to search and obtain external\ninformation. However, the queries generated by such Agentic RAG models and the\nrole of the retriever in obtaining high-quality answers remain understudied. To\nthis end, this initial study examines the applicability of query performance\nprediction (QPP) within the recent Agentic RAG models Search-R1 and\nR1-Searcher. We find that applying effective retrievers can achieve higher\nanswer quality within a shorter reasoning process. Moreover, the QPP estimates\nof the generated queries, used as an approximation of their retrieval quality,\nare positively correlated with the quality of the final answer. Ultimately, our\nwork is a step towards adaptive retrieval within Agentic RAG, where QPP is used\nto inform the model if the retrieved results are likely to be useful.",

However,\nmost text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to\nexploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the\nall-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the\nspectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1\nSAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual\nannotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from\nauthoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific\nsources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),\na novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR\nimages into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves\na new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.\nAdditionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent\ndifficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge\nfrom the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which\nintegrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful\ntrade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general\nsemantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving\nlocation-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features.

        "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful\ncapabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies\nto time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the\ngiven historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge\nlearned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning\nstrategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and\nsemantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical\ntime series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to\nachieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly\ntrained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn\nhigh-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel\nTransformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla\nTransformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations\nlearned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series\nTransformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the\nrepresentations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused\nrepresentation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic\nvariation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values.\nExperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach.",

        "abstract": "Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly\nimproving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this\nwork, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,\ndirectly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at\nthe beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these\nfixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe\nthat, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical\nrepresentations. These representations either integrate significant information\nfrom preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through\nlayer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final\noutput. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential\nto greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we\npropose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that\nidentifies and optimizes these critical representations through information\nflow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework,\ndynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace\nwhile freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method\nare validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning,\nusing LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts\neffectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%.

Consequently, the internal\nstructures of heterogeneous graphs are updated with the feedback item\nrepresentations during training.

Through comprehensive experiments across four benchmark\ndatasets with varying levels of sparsity, we demonstrate that our strategy\nyields noticeable improvements (i.e., 8.1% on average) during testing time with\nlittle to no additional computational overheads (i.e., 0.5 on average).

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies\nfor retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to\naccess external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is\nup-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to\ncreate chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account\nfor the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework\nthat enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering\nto generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference,\nthe framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and\ncluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of\nretrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on\nthe NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method\nachieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.",

Finally, we find that this function\ninduction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic\ntasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8\naddition.

Experiments on the NitiBench benchmark demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements: GRPO achieves up to 90% citation-F1 gains from the\nbase model and a 31% increase in joint quality metrics over instruction tuning.\nCrucially, our method shows enhanced robustness on complex legal reasoning\ntasks compared to instruction tuning, providing an effective and\nresource-efficient solution for enhancing Thai legal LLMs.",

We systematically evaluate how both humanly\nplausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two\nrelated tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We\nprovide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the\nmodels respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.\n  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many\nerrors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without\nerrors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently,\nwith character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than\nphrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality\nlargely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting\ntranslation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with\noverwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans.",

Most existing benchmarks rely on manually\ncollected test cases, many of which cannot be automatically checked for\nsemantic correctness and instead depend on static methods such as string\nmatching. Additionally, these benchmarks often overlook the complex\ninteractions that occur between sequential API calls, which are common in\nreal-world applications. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce StateGen,\nan automated framework designed to generate diverse coding tasks involving\nsequential API interactions. StateGen combines state-machine-based API\nconstraint solving and validation, energy-based sampling, and control-flow\ninjection to generate executable programs. These programs are then translated\ninto human-like natural language task descriptions through a collaboration of\ntwo LLM agents. Utilizing StateGen, we construct StateEval, a benchmark\nencompassing 120 verified test cases spanning across three representative\nscenarios: Session Service, Tensor Operation, and ElevenLabs MCP. Experimental\nresults confirm that StateGen can effectively generate challenging and\nrealistic API-oriented tasks, highlighting areas for improvement in current\nLLMs incorporating APIs.",

We argue that in\nenvironments with large and rapidly expanding item inventories, the traditional\nfocus on finding the \"best item for a user\" can inadvertently obscure the ideal\naudience for nascent content. To counter this, we introduce the concept of\nitem-centric recommendations, shifting the paradigm to identify the optimal\nusers for new items. Our initial realization of this vision involves an\nitem-centric control integrated into an exploration system. This control\nemploys a Bayesian model with Beta distributions to assess candidate items\nbased on a predicted balance between user satisfaction and the item's inherent\nquality. Empirical online evaluations reveal that this straightforward control\nmarkedly improves cold-start targeting efficacy, enhances user satisfaction\nwith newly explored content, and significantly increases overall exploration\nefficiency.",

        "abstract": "Two-tower neural networks are a popular architecture for the retrieval stage\nin recommender systems. These models are typically trained with a softmax loss\nover the item catalog. However, in web-scale settings, the item catalog is\noften prohibitively large, making full softmax infeasible. A common solution is\nsampled softmax, which approximates the full softmax using a small number of\nsampled negatives.\n  One practical and widely adopted approach is to use in-batch negatives, where\nnegatives are drawn from items in the current mini-batch. However, this\nintroduces a bias: items that appear more frequently in the batch (i.e.,\npopular items) are penalized more heavily.\n  To mitigate this issue, a popular industry technique known as logQ correction\nadjusts the logits during training by subtracting the log-probability of an\nitem appearing in the batch. This correction is derived by analyzing the bias\nin the gradient and applying importance sampling, effectively twice, using the\nin-batch distribution as a proposal distribution. While this approach improves\nmodel quality, it does not fully eliminate the bias.\n  In this work, we revisit the derivation of logQ correction and show that it\noverlooks a subtle but important detail: the positive item in the denominator\nis not Monte Carlo-sampled - it is always present with probability 1. We\npropose a refined correction formula that accounts for this. Notably, our loss\nintroduces an interpretable sample weight that reflects the model's uncertainty\n- the probability of misclassification under the current parameters. We\nevaluate our method on both public and proprietary datasets, demonstrating\nconsistent improvements over the standard logQ correction.",

        "title": "Prompt4Trust: A Reinforcement Learning Prompt Augmentation Framework for Clinically-Aligned Confidence Calibration in Multimodal Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for\napplications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical\nsettings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,\nand (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As\nclinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of\nits predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high\nconfidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting\nconfidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce\ncontext-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate\nresponses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive\naccuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically\nprioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy\nclinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically\nmotivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task\naccuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)\nperformance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice\nquestions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework\ntrained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot\ngeneralization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for\nscalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work\ndemonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering\nfor improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

        "abstract": "Humour translation plays a vital role as a bridge between different cultures,\nfostering understanding and communication. Although most existing Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) are capable of general translation tasks, these models\nstill struggle with humour translation, which is especially reflected through\nlinguistic interference and lacking humour in translated text. In this paper,\nwe propose a psychology-inspired Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) that\nutilises Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to imitate the ability of the human thought\nprocess, stimulating LLMs to optimise the readability of translated humorous\ntexts. Moreover, we integrate humour theory in HDM to further enhance the\nhumorous elements in the translated text. Our automatic evaluation experiments\non open-source humour datasets demonstrate that our method significantly\nimproves the quality of humour translation, yielding average gains of 7.75\\% in\nhumour, 2.81\\% in fluency, and 6.13\\% in coherence of the generated text.",

        "title": "Ambiguity-Aware and High-Order Relation Learning for Multi-Grained Image-Text Matching",
        "abstract": "Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer\nvision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face\nchallenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among\nsimilar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft\npositive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft\nnegative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching\nuncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the\nneighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training\nbatches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.\nThis paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning\nframework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified\nrepresentation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,\neffectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework\nintroduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive\naggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic\nunderstanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and\ninter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships\namong sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic\ninteractions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum\ncontrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined\nstrategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between\nfeatures. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,\nconsiderably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching.

        "abstract": "Visual metaphors of climate change (e.g., melting glaciers depicted as a\nmelting ice grenade) are regarded as valuable tools for addressing the\ncomplexity of environmental challenges. However, few studies have examined\ntheir impact on communication, also due to scattered availability of material.\nHere, we present a novel database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images\n(MetaClimage) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15861012, paired with literal\nimages and enriched with human ratings. For each image, we collected values of\ndifficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human\nrating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the\nmessage. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via\nNatural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to\nunderstand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not\ndiffer in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was\nhigher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual\nmetaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the\nimage, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than\nliteral images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual\nmetaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper\ncognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,\nwhile they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem\nto generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced\nexperience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the impact of\nvisual metaphors of climate change both by offering a database for future\nresearch and by elucidating a cost-benefit trade-off to take into account when\nshaping environmental communication.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has\ngained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow\nspecialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for\ncomprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel\ngeneralist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven,\nmulti-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising\njudgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning\nthrough rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment\ncapabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy\ngradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves\nsuperior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model\ndemonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models\nlike DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a\ncomprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank\nconsistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance\nrobust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation\nstandards.",

However, the inherently high frame\nrate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding\ncapabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only\nprocess 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its\ncapacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the\ncontinuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This\npaper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual\nsemantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of\nunlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM\nprogressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary\nLoRA module during inference to effectively \"memorize\" the contextual\ninformation. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM\ninto inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC).

        "abstract": "The rapid spread of health misinformation on online social networks (OSNs)\nduring global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges to public\nhealth, social stability, and institutional trust. Centrality metrics have long\nbeen pivotal in understanding the dynamics of information flow, particularly in\nthe context of health misinformation. However, the increasing complexity and\ndynamism of online networks, especially during crises, highlight the\nlimitations of these traditional approaches. This study introduces and compares\nthree novel centrality metrics: dynamic influence centrality (DIC), health\nmisinformation vulnerability centrality (MVC), and propagation centrality (PC).\nThese metrics incorporate temporal dynamics, susceptibility, and multilayered\nnetwork interactions. Using the FibVID dataset, we compared traditional and\nnovel metrics to identify influential nodes, propagation pathways, and\nmisinformation influencers. Traditional metrics identified 29 influential\nnodes, while the new metrics uncovered 24 unique nodes, resulting in 42\ncombined nodes, an increase of 44.83%. Baseline interventions reduced health\nmisinformation by 50%, while incorporating the new metrics increased this to\n62.5%, an improvement of 25%. To evaluate the broader applicability of the\nproposed metrics, we validated our framework on a second dataset, Monant\nMedical Misinformation, which covers a diverse range of health misinformation\ndiscussions beyond COVID-19. The results confirmed that the advanced metrics\ngeneralised successfully, identifying distinct influential actors not captured\nby traditional methods. In general, the findings suggest that a combination of\ntraditional and novel centrality measures offers a more robust and\ngeneralisable framework for understanding and mitigating the spread of health\nmisinformation in different online network contexts.",

Transformer-based LLMs face\nsignificant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,\ndue to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value\n(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods.

Extensive evaluation across diverse LLMs and benchmarks\ndemonstrates that SIMS substantially outperforms existing methods in steering\neffectiveness and adaptability, highlighting self-improving model steering as a\npromising direction for future research on inference-time LLM alignment.",

        "abstract": "Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches are common in\ntext-based applications. However, they struggle with structured, interconnected\ndatasets like knowledge graphs, where understanding underlying relationships is\ncrucial for accurate retrieval. A common direction in graph-based retrieval\nemploys iterative, rule-based traversal guided by Large Language Models (LLMs).\nSuch existing iterative methods typically combine reasoning with single hop\ntraversal at each step, making them vulnerable to LLM reasoning errors and\nhallucinations that ultimately hinder the retrieval of relevant information.\n  To address these limitations, we propose GraphRunner, a novel graph-based\nretrieval framework that operates in three distinct stages: planning,\nverification, and execution. This introduces high-level traversal actions that\nenable multi-hop exploration in a single step. It also generates a holistic\ntraversal plan, which is verified against the graph structure and pre-defined\ntraversal actions, reducing reasoning errors and detecting hallucinations\nbefore execution. GraphRunner significantly reduces LLM reasoning errors and\ndetects hallucinations through validation. Our evaluation using the GRBench\ndataset shows that GraphRunner consistently outperforms existing approaches,\nachieving 10-50% performance improvements over the strongest baseline while\nreducing inference cost by 3.0-12.9x and response generation time by 2.5-7.1x,\nmaking it significantly more robust and efficient for graph-based retrieval\ntasks.",
