        "abstract": "Accurately modeling query-item relevance drives e-commerce ranking, yet\nlong-tail, knowledge-heavy, and fast-evolving queries exceed parametric LLM\ncoverage. External context (reviews, attribute encyclopedias, UGC) can help but\nis noisy, and single-pass latency and cost forbid any clean-then-summarize\nstep. The model must, per query, judge relevance and decide whether to use,\npartially use, or ignore the context. DyKnow-RAG is a dynamic noisy-RAG\nframework built on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It trains two rollout\ngroups (no external context vs a single retrieved chunk) and applies\nposterior-driven inter-group advantage scaling that adaptively reweights their\ncontributions by the per-query correctness gap. This teaches when to trust\nretrieval versus fall back to parametric knowledge, without process labels,\nvalue networks, or extra inference passes, preserving single-pass, single-chunk\ndeployment under production latency. Training combines: (1) supervised\ninitialization with a structured rationale that explicitly records the\ncontext-usage decision; (2) an RL pool prioritized by SFT uncertainty to focus\nwhere context choice is most consequential; and (3) an optional lightweight DPO\nwarm start to stabilize with-context calibration. Under a unified\nretrieval/index and fixed latency budget, DyKnow-RAG outperforms SFT, DPO, and\nvanilla GRPO in offline tests, and delivers consistent lifts on GSB, Query\nGoodrate, and Item Goodrate in Taobao A/B testing. It is deployed in Taobao's\nproduction relevance system, serving live traffic. To our knowledge, it is\namong the first single-pass RAG solutions for e-commerce relevance, turning\nnoisy external signals into reliable gains without added online complexity.",

However, existing approaches\ntypically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and\nmultimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained\ninteractions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper,\nwe propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a\nmodality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between\nID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user\ninterest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge\nthe semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side\ninformation to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling.\nFurthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that\ndecouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings\nbefore the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck\nintroduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive\nmultimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned\nunder the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline\nexperiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nDMF. Moreover, DMF has been deployed on the product recommendation system of\nthe international e-commerce platform Lazada, achieving relative improvements\nof 5.30% in CTCVR and 7.43% in GMV with negligible computational overhead.",

        "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a cornerstone of modern recommender\nsystems, has been dominated by discriminative models that react to past user\nbehavior rather than proactively modeling user intent. Existing generative\nparadigms attempt to address this but suffer from critical limitations: Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) based methods create a semantic mismatch by forcing\ne-commerce signals into a linguistic space, while ID-based generation is\nconstrained by item memorization and cold-start issues. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel generative pre-training paradigm. Our model\nlearns to predict the Next Interest Flow, a dense vector sequence representing\na user's future intent, while simultaneously modeling its internal Interest\nDiversity and Interest Evolution Velocity to ensure the representation is both\nrich and coherent. However, this two-stage approach introduces a critical\nobjective mismatch between the generative and discriminative stages. We resolve\nthis via a bidirectional alignment strategy, which harmonizes the two stages\nthrough cross-stage weight initialization and a dynamic Semantic Alignment\nModule for fine-tuning. Additionally, we enhance the underlying discriminative\nmodel with a Temporal Sequential Pairwise (TSP) mechanism to better capture\ntemporal causality. We present the All-domain Moveline Evolution Network\n(AMEN), a unified framework implementing our entire pipeline.

Existing studies often treat utility as a generic\nattribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from\nthe same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension\nability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion\nof LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple\ndatasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal\nfor LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across\ndifferent LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the\nLLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some\nhuman-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific\nLLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for\nLLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,\nwe propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We\nevaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while\nverbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to\nassess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and\nto select truly useful ones for unknown queries.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented reasoning (RAR) is a recent evolution of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that employs multiple reasoning steps for\nretrieval and generation. While effective for some complex queries, RAR remains\nvulnerable to errors and misleading outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)\noffers methods to estimate the confidence of systems' outputs. These methods,\nhowever, often handle simple queries with no retrieval or single-step\nretrieval, without properly handling RAR setup. Accurate estimation of UQ for\nRAR requires accounting for all sources of uncertainty, including those arising\nfrom retrieval and generation. In this paper, we account for all these sources\nand introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Consistency (R2C)--a novel UQ\nmethod for RAR. The core idea of R2C is to perturb the multi-step reasoning\nprocess by applying various actions to reasoning steps. These perturbations\nalter the retriever's input, which shifts its output and consequently modifies\nthe generator's input at the next step. Through this iterative feedback loop,\nthe retriever and generator continuously reshape one another's inputs, enabling\nus to capture uncertainty arising from both components. Experiments on five\npopular RAR systems across diverse QA datasets show that R2C improves AUROC by\nover 5% on average compared to the state-of-the-art UQ baselines. Extrinsic\nevaluations using R2C as an external signal further confirm its effectiveness\nfor two downstream tasks: in Abstention, it achieves ~5% gains in both\nF1Abstain and AccAbstain; in Model Selection, it improves the exact match by\n~7% over single models and ~3% over selection methods.",

This method provides numerous benefits,\nincluding fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed\nto zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training\nin such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information\nretrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text\ninstance is \"similar\" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label\nis determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art\nsentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text\ninstance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary\nclassification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon\nprevious literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and\nevaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based\nclassification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the\nsemantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,\nand label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic\nmulti-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity\ndistributions show statistically significant differences across models,\ndatasets and even label sets.

In this paper, we ask: Along what dimensions do\ngenerative search outputs differ from traditional web search? We compare\nGoogle, a traditional web search engine, with four generative search engines\nfrom two providers (Google and OpenAI) across queries from four domains. Our\nanalysis reveals intriguing differences. Most generative search engines cover a\nwider range of sources compared to web search. Generative search engines vary\nin the degree to which they rely on internal knowledge contained within the\nmodel parameters v.s. external knowledge retrieved from the web.

        "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which models behavior sequence and\nnon-sequential features (e.g., user/item profiles or cross features) to infer\nuser interest, underpins industrial recommender systems. However, most methods\nface three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i)\nFeature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less\ngranular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features,\nthereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity\narises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items,\nyet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the\nentire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented\nintegration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's\neffectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle\nthe above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for\nmodeling sequential and set-wise contexts. First, we align sequence side\nfeatures with non-sequential features for accurate sequence modeling and\nfine-grained interest representation. Second, we shift the prediction paradigm\nfrom point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly\nparallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves\ndual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation,\nensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model\nsize. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer\nsuccessfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the\nAUC metric, and enhances online business metrics like CTR/RPM by 1.99%/2.46%.\nAdditionally, HoMer saves 27% of GPU resources via preliminary engineering\noptimization, further validating its superiority and practicality.",

        "abstract": "Query-service relevance prediction in e-commerce search systems faces strict\nlatency requirements that prevent the direct application of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage reasoning\ndistillation framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a powerful\nteacher LLM to a lightweight, deployment-friendly student model. In the first\nstage, we address the limitations of general-purpose LLMs by constructing a\ndomain-adapted teacher model. This is achieved through a three-step process:\ndomain-adaptive pre-training to inject platform knowledge, supervised\nfine-tuning to elicit reasoning skills, and preference optimization with a\nmulti-dimensional reward model to ensure the generation of reliable and\npreference-aligned reasoning paths. This teacher can then automatically\nannotate massive query-service pairs from search logs with both relevance\nlabels and reasoning chains. In the second stage, to address the challenges of\narchitectural heterogeneity in standard distillation, we introduce Contrastive\nReasoning Self-Distillation (CRSD). By modeling the behavior of the same\nstudent model under \"standard\" and \"reasoning-augmented\" inputs as a\nteacher-student relationship, CRSD enables the lightweight model to internalize\nthe teacher's complex decision-making mechanisms without needing the explicit\nreasoning path at inference. Offline evaluations and online A/B testing in the\nMeituan search advertising system demonstrate that our framework achieves\nsignificant improvements across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness\nand practical value.",

Evaluations of artificial intelligence\n(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how\nmodels play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new\nparadigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a\nformalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale\ndataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare\nevaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of\npeople and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative\nqueries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These\nqueries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI\nevaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to\nquantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to\npeople in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.\nHowever, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to\ngame-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more\n\"jaggedness\" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater\ndifficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning\nmodels show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing\nqueries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational\nmeta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.",

While this ability is useful for interacting\nwith structured data like code files, another popular method,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment\nthe model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best\nrepresent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,\nparticularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a\nnovel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a\nGitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each\nhierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a\nknowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using\nRAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the\ngenerated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable\nacross both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the\nretriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that\nleveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and\nscalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.",

While models display impressive accuracy on factual\nquestion-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex\nqueries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,\nwe introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a\ncontrolled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual\nquestions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex\nqueries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic\nmisalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further\nuncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive\ncorrect or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through\nmechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model\ninternals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict\nshort-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes\nfactual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'\ntrustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly\nassume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in\nmore complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), owing to their extensive open-domain knowledge\nand semantic reasoning capabilities, have been increasingly integrated into\nrecommender systems (RS). However, a substantial gap remains between the\npre-training objectives of LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation\ntasks. To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed\non specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their\npredictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it\ninduces Language Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens-such\nas task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens-while underutilizing core user\ninteraction tokens that encode user-specific preferences. This bias not only\nundermines recommendation accuracy but also raises unfairness concerns.\n  To address this issue, we propose Group Distributionally Robust\nOptimization-based Tuning (GDRT), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that enforces\nconsistent model performance across token groups with varying degrees of\nrelevance to auxiliary tokens. By adaptively upweighting underperforming\ngroups, typically those weakly correlated with auxiliary tokens, GDRT shifts\nthe model's attention from superficial auxiliary cues to informative user\ninteraction tokens, thereby mitigating language bias. Extensive experiments\nconducted on three public datasets demonstrate that GDRT effectively mitigates\nlanguage bias, yielding substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy\n(with an average NDCG@10 gain of 24.29%) and significantly enhancing\nrecommendation fairness.",

By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the\nmodels to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.\nThe powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and\nwill refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the\njailbreak methods.

Specifically, we first uncover\na surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template\ntokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful\nguardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we\nintroduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based\nguardrails.

Current\nretrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using\nthe informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:\ninformal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on\nthe underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel\nframework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into\nsmaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval\nof premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT\nretrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in\nformalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,\nConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise\nretrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on\nProofNet.

This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based\napproaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative\npretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals\nwithin a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through\nanalysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm\nthat latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve\nas a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a\nLanguage-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its\neffectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.\nFurthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),\nshowing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive\nrefinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This\nsuggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm\nfor enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of\nGRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on\nits representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource\nvisual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining\nbefore CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding\ncapabilities.

To address this, we propose\nDocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their\nstructure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired\ndocuments, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-\nand low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure\nand style.

        "title": "HatLLM: Hierarchical Attention Masking for Enhanced Collaborative Modeling in LLM-based Recommendation",
        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a surge of research on leveraging large language\nmodels (LLMs) for sequential recommendation. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable\npotential in inferring users' nuanced preferences through fine-grained semantic\nreasoning. However, they also exhibit a notable limitation in effectively\nmodeling collaborative signals, i.e., behavioral correlations inherent in\nusers' historical interactions. Our empirical analysis further reveals that the\nattention mechanisms in LLMs tend to disproportionately focus on tokens within\nthe same item, thereby impeding the capture of cross-item correlations.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a novel hierarchical attention masking\nstrategy for LLM-based recommendation, termed HatLLM. Specifically, in shallow\nlayers, HatLLM masks attention between tokens from different items,\nfacilitating intra-item semantic understanding; in contrast, in deep layers,\nHatLLM masks attention within items, thereby compelling the model to capture\ncross-item correlations. This progressive, layer-wise approach enables LLMs to\njointly model both token-level and item-level dependencies. Extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HatLLM achieves\nsignificant performance gains (9.13% on average) over existing LLM-based\nmethods.",

        "abstract": "Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models\nis a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent\nstudies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a\nmismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this\nissue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis\nstrategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create\ndata tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.\nSpecifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a\nquery-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher\nresponse quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned\nprompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate\nthen Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for\nthe entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive\nexperiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn\nconsistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in\ninstruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the\neffectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.",

        "title": "Deconstructing Attention: Investigating Design Principles for Effective Language Modeling",
        "abstract": "The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their\ndot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design\nprinciples: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token\ninteractions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to\neach input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus\nsoftmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states\n(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of\nthese principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically\ndeconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax\nthese principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid\narchitectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical\nanalysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their\nabsence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical\nform and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when\npreserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in\nisolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard\nattention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our\nunderstanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new\navenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.",

        "abstract": "Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands\nthe ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research\nshows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in\nfive cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to\nfully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques\nthat require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL\nthat strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility\nboundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework\ncombines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and\nclassifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based\nrewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through\ninternal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens\nconsistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.\nIn experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved\nself-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic\nbenchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external\nsupervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,\noutperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially\nunlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge\nawareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer\ndeployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence\nfrom external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process\nto all future models.",

Systems designed to address this\nchallenge are often trained with supervision from warm CF models in order to\nleverage collaborative and content information from the available interaction\ndata. However, since they learn to replicate the behavior of CF methods,\ncold-start models may therefore also learn to imitate their predictive biases.\nIn this paper, we show that cold-start systems can inherit popularity bias, a\ncommon cause of recommender system unfairness arising when CF models overfit to\nmore popular items, thereby maximizing user-oriented accuracy but neglecting\nrarer items. We demonstrate that cold-start recommenders not only mirror the\npopularity biases of warm models, but are in fact affected more severely:\nbecause they cannot infer popularity from interaction data, they instead\nattempt to estimate it based solely on content features. This leads to\nsignificant over-prediction of certain cold items with similar content to\npopular warm items, even if their ground truth popularity is very low. Through\nexperiments on three multimedia datasets, we analyze the impact of this\nbehavior on three generative cold-start methods. We then describe a simple\npost-processing bias mitigation method that, by using embedding magnitude as a\nproxy for predicted popularity, can produce more balanced recommendations with\nlimited harm to user-oriented cold-start accuracy.",

The challenge is amplified by web\nagents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and\nenvironmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address\nthis, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an\ninformation-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware\nVariational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a\ncompressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the\nexpected operational cost.

        "abstract": "Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification\n(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and\nproduct-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels\nranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear\nclassification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns\ninto the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art\nXMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we\nshow can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and\ncomputational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically\nretain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose\nELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and\nFloat8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we\ndemonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,\nwithout relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.\nLow-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --\ngradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory\nusage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of\nGPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,\nRenee without compromising accuracy.",

This oversight may\nresult in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final\nreport. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a\ncomprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain\nevaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple\nmetrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report\ndimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce\nDRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation\nspans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash,\nDeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success\nrate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%.

Previous methods recognize\ndiscontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which\nface challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide\nvariety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply\nexplore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid\ntagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our\nGapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps\nbetween entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance\ndiscontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an\nadditional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid\ntagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to\ncomprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span\nperspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine\nmechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of\neach span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes\ncriss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At\nthe inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each\nentity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all\nvalid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental\nresults on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable\nadvantages in recognizing complex entity structures.",

        "abstract": "Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model\n(LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches\ntypically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which\noften leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off\ncourse due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for\nsmaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we\nanalyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning\nand execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from\nincorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan\nAggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan\nexploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on\nthe token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them\ninto a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design\nin which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA\nmodule implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that\noutcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K\ntokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level\npreference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo\n(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields\nmore efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive\nexperiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks\ndemonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method\noutperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward\nRL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.",

        "title": "Towards Real-Time Fake News Detection under Evidence Scarcity",
        "abstract": "Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,\nwhere emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing\napproaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to\ngeneralize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose\nEvaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time\nfake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process\naccording to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a\nsequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)\nEvidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into\ndecision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)\nReasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is\nadequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates\nsentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the\naccuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo\nlabels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge\nthrough interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the\nevaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable\nevaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.\nMoreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news\nfor evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves\ngeneralization to real-time news.

        "title": "Can Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Generalize Across Diverse Domains?",
        "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of\ntool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of\nan LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively\ntrained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training\ndomain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning\ndomains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical\ntasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,\nenabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this\ncross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning\n(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill\nmigration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts\ndomain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,\nfostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system\nthat decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool\nefficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across\ndomain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,\ntool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and\ncoherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse\nbenchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and\nhighlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.",

        "abstract": "With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a\nparadigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often\nrequired to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This\nenables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,\nhowever, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the\nassumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and\nthus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation\nmethod that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution\nto reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.\nEAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of\nhigh-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the\ninstances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that\nacross multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME\n2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,\nachieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning\nlength and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%\nfewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in\nPass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.",

However, their outputs\noften contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks\nwhen deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper\nintroduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security\nand robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and\nverifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the\nStainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments\nwith leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often\nfails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure\ncode, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input\nvalidation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential\nof structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the\ntrustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.",
