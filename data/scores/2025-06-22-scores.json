        "abstract": "We introduce eSapiens, a unified question-answering system designed for\nenterprise settings, which bridges structured databases and unstructured\ntextual corpora via a dual-module architecture. The system combines a\nText-to-SQL planner with a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\npipeline, enabling natural language access to both relational data and\nfree-form documents. To enhance answer faithfulness, the RAG module integrates\ndense and sparse retrieval, commercial reranking, and a citation verification\nloop that ensures grounding consistency. We evaluate eSapiens on the RAGTruth\nbenchmark across five leading large language models (LLMs), analyzing\nperformance across key dimensions such as completeness, hallucination, and\ncontext utilization. Results demonstrate that eSapiens outperforms a FAISS\nbaseline in contextual relevance and generation quality, with optional\nstrict-grounding controls for high-stakes scenarios. This work provides a\ndeployable framework for robust, citation-aware question answering in\nreal-world enterprise applications.",

Training dense retrievers typically\nrequires annotated query-document pairs, which are costly and hard to obtain in\nspecialized domains such as code-motivating growing interest in self-supervised\nretriever learning. Since LMs are trained to capture token-level dependencies\nthrough a self-supervised learning objective (i.e., next-token prediction), we\ncan analogously cast retrieval as learning dependencies among chunks of tokens.\nThis analogy naturally leads to the question: How can we adapt self-supervised\nlearning objectives in the spirit of language modeling to train retrievers?\n  To answer this question, we introduce Revela, a unified and scalable training\nframework for self-supervised retriever learning via language modeling. Revela\nmodels semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next-token\nprediction on both local and cross-document context through an in-batch\nattention mechanism. This attention is weighted by retriever-computed\nsimilarity scores, enabling the retriever to be optimized as part of language\nmodeling. We evaluate Revela on both general-domain (BEIR) and domain-specific\n(CoIR) benchmarks across various retriever backbones. At a comparable parameter\nscale, Revela outperforms the previous best method with absolute improvements\nof 5.2 % (18.3 % relative) and 5.6 % (14.4 % relative) on NDCG@10,\nrespectively, underscoring its effectiveness.

To overcome these limitations, recent research has explored the use of\nsemantic tokens as an alternative to ID tokens, which typically leveraged\nreconstruction-based strategies, like RQ-VAE, to quantize content embeddings\nand significantly reduce the embedding size. However, reconstructive\nquantization aims for the precise reconstruction of each item embedding\nindependently, which conflicts with the goal of generative retrieval tasks\nfocusing more on differentiating among items. Moreover, multi-modal side\ninformation of items, such as descriptive text and images, geographical\nknowledge in location-based recommendation services, has been shown to be\neffective in improving recommendations by providing richer contexts for\ninteractions. Nevertheless, effectively integrating such complementary\nknowledge into existing generative recommendation frameworks remains\nchallenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised deep\nquantization exclusively based on contrastive learning, named SimCIT (a Simple\nContrastive Item Tokenization framework). Specifically, different from existing\nreconstruction-based strategies, SimCIT propose to use a learnable residual\nquantization module to align with the signals from different modalities of the\nitems, which combines multi-modal knowledge alignment and semantic tokenization\nin a mutually beneficial contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments\nacross public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset from various\ndomains demonstrate SimCIT's effectiveness in LLM-based generative\nrecommendation.",

The mixer layers are stacked in a pyramid way for\ncross-period user temporal interest learning. Through extensive offline and\nonline experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our\nmethod, and we obtain a +0.106% improvement in user stay duration and a\n+0.0113% increase in user active days in the online A/B test. The Pyramid Mixer\nhas been successfully deployed on the industrial platform, demonstrating its\nscalability and impact in real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust\nreasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical\ndomain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT)\ntraining data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical\nMLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a\ncomprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths\ntowards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern\nCollaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to\ngenerate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor\nmodels to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each\nintern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally\nselects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning\nperformance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined\nby an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths.\nEventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with\nranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum\nlearning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable\nreasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1,\ntrained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning\nbenchmarks.

Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered\nchallenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to\nthe target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we\npropose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models\nvia Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to\niteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while\ninducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with\ncomputational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential\nsynonym search, and its advanced version--order-determining optimization.\nExtensive experiments across two open-source models and four closed-source\nmodels demonstrate that MIST achieves competitive attack success rates and\nattack transferability compared with other state-of-the-art white-box and\nblack-box jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct experiments on\ncomputational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.",

Using legislative data from South Korea's 21st National Assembly,\nwe identify key factors - including sponsor characteristics, political\naffiliations, and geographic variables - that significantly influence\ntransportation policymaking. The LLM was used to classify\ntransportation-related bill proposals through a stepwise filtering process\nbased on keywords, phrases, and contextual relevance. XAI techniques were then\napplied to examine relationships between party affiliation and associated\nattributes. The results reveal that the number and proportion of conservative\nand progressive sponsors, along with district size and electoral population,\nare critical determinants shaping legislative outcomes.

In this work, we propose a preference-aligned\nrouting framework that guides model selection by matching queries to\nuser-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) --\noffering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions.\nSpecifically, we introduce \\textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that\nlearns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions.\nOur approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without\nrequiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on\nconversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top\nproprietary models.

Yet, with an ever-growing volume of\ninformation, science communicators struggle to anticipate how audiences will\nperceive and interact with scientific news. In this paper, we introduce a\ncomputational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions,\nsuch as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework,\nwe create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations\nfrom 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable\ninsights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We\nfurther develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong\nperformance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of\nscience from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors\naffect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a\npredictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement\nwith science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption\nis the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal\ninfluence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully\ndesigned natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public\nperception of scientific information has direct connections with the final\nengagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive\nsignificantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different\nscientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently.\nOverall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception\nmodeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public\ninterest and engagement with scientific content.",

However, to\nthe best of our knowledge, there remains a lack of comprehensive studies on\nmulti-objective recommendation systems based on generative AI technologies,\nleaving a significant gap in the literature. Therefore, we investigate the\nexisting research on multi-objective recommendation systems involving\ngenerative AI to bridge this gap.

        "abstract": "With the rapid progress of speech language models (SLMs), discrete speech\ntokens have emerged as a core interface between speech and text, enabling\nunified modeling across modalities. Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a\nnatural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across\nframes, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM\nalignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method\nthat introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching\nteacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from\nsemantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded\nrepresentations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a\nfrozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet\ndata-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are\nmore semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates\narchitectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization,\nand supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.\nExperimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity\ncompared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve\ncompetitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform\nbaselines on text-to-speech tasks.",

In the first stage, Zero-RL\nis used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the\nlikelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel\nevaluation metric, $R^\\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their\ngeneration likelihood.

We consider\nthis to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of\nfine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the \"attack\". Most\nwell-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM\nwith reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily\nexploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make\nany meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and\nreproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a\nsafety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and\nthe stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising\nvariance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly\ninconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup.

        "abstract": "Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and\nvision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal\nmechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving\nbehavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by\nassigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model\ncomponents. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer\nperceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual\nassociations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook\nthe impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for\nanalyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable\nAttention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping\narbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer\nmodels. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,\ncalculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the\nTopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We\nthen propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to\ndiminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module\nusing only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on\nconcepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their\ncorresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain\nstable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the\nmechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on\nHarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing \"safety\" and improve performance on the GSM8K\nbenchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying \"reasoning\".

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a robust mastery of syntax when\nprocessing and generating text. While this suggests internalized understanding\nof hierarchical syntax and dependency relations, the precise mechanism by which\nthey represent syntactic structure is an open area within interpretability\nresearch. Probing provides one way to identify the mechanism of syntax being\nlinearly encoded in activations, however, no comprehensive study has yet\nestablished whether a model's probing accuracy reliably predicts its downstream\nsyntactic performance. Adopting a \"mechanisms vs. outcomes\" framework, we\nevaluate 32 open-weight transformer models and find that syntactic features\nextracted via probing fail to predict outcomes of targeted syntax evaluations\nacross English linguistic phenomena. Our results highlight a substantial\ndisconnect between latent syntactic representations found via probing and\nobservable syntactic behaviors in downstream tasks.",

        "title": "Advancing Harmful Content Detection in Organizational Research: Integrating Large Language Models with Elo Rating System",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for organizational\nresearch. However, their built-in moderation systems can create problems when\nresearchers try to analyze harmful content, often refusing to follow certain\ninstructions or producing overly cautious responses that undermine validity of\nthe results. This is particularly problematic when analyzing organizational\nconflicts such as microaggressions or hate speech. This paper introduces an Elo\nrating-based method that significantly improves LLM performance for harmful\ncontent analysis In two datasets, one focused on microaggression detection and\nthe other on hate speech, we find that our method outperforms traditional LLM\nprompting techniques and conventional machine learning models on key measures\nsuch as accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. Advantages include better\nreliability when analyzing harmful content, fewer false positives, and greater\nscalability for large-scale datasets. This approach supports organizational\napplications, including detecting workplace harassment, assessing toxic\ncommunication, and fostering safer and more inclusive work environments.",

        "title": "Weight Factorization and Centralization for Continual Learning in Speech Recognition",
        "abstract": "Modern neural network based speech recognition models are required to\ncontinually absorb new data without re-training the whole system, especially in\ndownstream applications using foundation models, having no access to the\noriginal training data. Continually training the models in a rehearsal-free,\nmultilingual, and language agnostic condition, likely leads to catastrophic\nforgetting, when a seemingly insignificant disruption to the weights can\ndestructively harm the quality of the models. Inspired by the ability of human\nbrains to learn and consolidate knowledge through the waking-sleeping cycle, we\npropose a continual learning approach with two distinct phases: factorization\nand centralization, learning and merging knowledge accordingly. Our experiments\non a sequence of varied code-switching datasets showed that the centralization\nstage can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting by accumulating the\nknowledge in multiple scattering low-rank adapters.",

        "title": "Automatic Speech Recognition Biases in Newcastle English: an Error Analysis",
        "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems struggle with regional dialects\ndue to biased training which favours mainstream varieties. While previous\nresearch has identified racial, age, and gender biases in ASR, regional bias\nremains underexamined. This study investigates ASR performance on Newcastle\nEnglish, a well-documented regional dialect known to be challenging for ASR. A\ntwo-stage analysis was conducted: first, a manual error analysis on a subsample\nidentified key phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors behind ASR\nmisrecognitions; second, a case study focused on the systematic analysis of ASR\nrecognition of the regional pronouns ``yous'' and ``wor''. Results show that\nASR errors directly correlate with regional dialectal features, while social\nfactors play a lesser role in ASR mismatches. We advocate for greater dialectal\ndiversity in ASR training data and highlight the value of sociolinguistic\nanalysis in diagnosing and addressing regional biases.",
