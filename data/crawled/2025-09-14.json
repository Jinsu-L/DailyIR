        "abstract": "Pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper perform\nwell but still need domain adaptation to handle unseen vocabulary and parlance.\nIn many real-world settings, collecting speech data is impractical,\nnecessitating text-only adaptation. We propose WhisTLE, a deeply supervised,\ntext-only adaptation method for pretrained encoder-decoder ASR models. WhisTLE\ntrains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text and\nfine-tunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, optionally\ncombined with text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation. At inference, the original\nencoder is restored, incurring no extra runtime cost. Across four out-of-domain\ndatasets and four ASR models, WhisTLE with TTS reduces word error rate (WER) by\n12.3% relative to TTS-only adaptation and outperforms all non-WhisTLE baselines\nin 27 of 32 scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks\nvia next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to\nclaims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a\nfew shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied\naccuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc\nencoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose\ngeneralisability.",

Current\nmethods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs,\nleading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\\%), which renders them\nimpractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental\ninability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if\ncorrecting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To\nbridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P)\nScaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from\npattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly\nguides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process\nwithin a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes\nbehind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective\nintervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and\nverify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach\nleverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a\nrigorous causal logic on the model's analysis.

However, though\nonly a few experts are activated for each token, SMoE still requires loading\nall expert parameters, leading to high memory usage and challenges in\ndeployment. Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and\nmerging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving\nneuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts,\nRecombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert\npruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and\ncontain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for\ndirect merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes\nredundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into\nneuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible\nretained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to\nbuild a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE\nmodels show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense\nreasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra\ntraining. It also greatly reduces the number of experts and memory usage,\nmaking SMoE LLMs easier to deploy in practice.",

The comparison between the GPT variants and\nthe best-performing open model yielded an edge for the latter. An analysis of\nclass-level factors points to the importance of support and substance overlaps\nbetween specific categories when it comes to performance on long text inputs.",

        "abstract": "In emotionally supportive conversations, well-intended positivity can\nsometimes misfire, leading to responses that feel dismissive, minimizing, or\nunrealistically optimistic. We examine this phenomenon of incongruent\npositivity as miscalibrated expressions of positive support in both human and\nLLM generated responses. To this end, we collected real user-assistant\ndialogues from Reddit across a range of emotional intensities and generated\nadditional responses using large language models for the same context. We\ncategorize these conversations by intensity into two levels: Mild, which covers\nrelationship tension and general advice, and Severe, which covers grief and\nanxiety conversations. This level of categorization enables a comparative\nanalysis of how supportive responses vary across lower and higher stakes\ncontexts. Our analysis reveals that LLMs are more prone to unrealistic\npositivity through dismissive and minimizing tone, particularly in high-stakes\ncontexts. To further study the underlying dimensions of this phenomenon, we\nfinetune LLMs on datasets with strong and weak emotional reactions. Moreover,\nwe developed a weakly supervised multilabel classifier ensemble (DeBERTa and\nMentalBERT) that shows improved detection of incongruent positivity types\nacross two sorts of concerns (Mild and Severe). Our findings shed light on the\nneed to move beyond merely generating generic positive responses and instead\nstudy the congruent support measures to balance positive affect with emotional\nacknowledgment. This approach offers insights into aligning large language\nmodels with affective expectations in the online supportive dialogue, paving\nthe way toward context-aware and trust preserving online conversation systems.",

A key challenge, however, is\nthe construction of persona sets that authentically represent the diversity and\ndistribution of real-world populations. Most existing LLM-based social\nsimulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and\nsimulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona\ngeneration and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona\nsets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing\nhigh-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation.\nOur approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from\nlong-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter\nout low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global\nalignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five\npersonality traits. To address the needs of specific simulation contexts, we\nfurther introduce a task-specific module that adapts the globally aligned\npersona set to targeted subpopulations.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we provide an extensive analysis of multi-label intent\nclassification using Large Language Models (LLMs) that are open-source,\npublicly available, and can be run in consumer hardware. We use the MultiWOZ\n2.1 dataset, a benchmark in the dialogue system domain, to investigate the\nefficacy of three popular open-source pre-trained LLMs, namely LLama2-7B-hf,\nMistral-7B-v0.1, and Yi-6B. We perform the classification task in a few-shot\nsetup, giving 20 examples in the prompt with some instructions. Our approach\nfocuses on the differences in performance of these models across several\nperformance metrics by methodically assessing these models on multi-label\nintent classification tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of the\ninstruction-based fine-tuning approach with supervised learning using the\nsmaller transformer model BertForSequenceClassification as a baseline. To\nevaluate the performance of the models, we use evaluation metrics like\naccuracy, precision, and recall as well as micro, macro, and weighted F1 score.\nWe also report the inference time, VRAM requirements, etc. The Mistral-7B-v0.1\noutperforms two other generative models on 11 intent classes out of 14 in terms\nof F-Score, with a weighted average of 0.50. It also has relatively lower\nHumming Loss and higher Jaccard Similarity, making it the winning model in the\nfew-shot setting.

We evaluate the\nreliability of LLM-generated synthetic survey responses against ground-truth\nhuman responses from a Chilean public opinion probabilistic survey.\nSpecifically, we benchmark 128 prompt-model-question triplets, generating\n189,696 synthetic profiles, and pool performance metrics (i.e., accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1-score) in a meta-analysis across 128\nquestion-subsample pairs to test for biases along key sociodemographic\ndimensions.

Although conversational turn organization has\nbeen studied by researchers from diverse fields, the specific strategies,\nespecially gestures used by communicators, had not yet been encoded in a\ndataset that can be used for machine learning. To fill this gap, we enriched\nthe Frame2 dataset with annotations of gestures used for turn organization.

This dataset\nallowed us to closely observe how communicators use interactive gestures\noutside a laboratory, in settings, to our knowledge, not previously recorded in\nrelated literature. Our results have confirmed that communicators involved in\nface-to-face conversation make use of gestures as a tool for passing, taking\nand keeping conversational turns, and also revealed variations of some gestures\nthat had not been documented before.

This paper\ninvestigates the hypothesis that a synergistic combination of these paradigms\ncan unlock superior performance and efficiency. We introduce HEFT (Hierarchical\nEfficient Fine-Tuning), a novel hierarchical adaptation strategy that composes\ntwo distinct PEFT methods in a coarse-to-fine manner: first, a broad,\nfoundational adaptation in the weight space using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),\nfollowed by a precise, surgical refinement of internal activations using\nRepresentation Fine-Tuning (ReFT).
