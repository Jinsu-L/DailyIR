#### T.A.R.G.E.T. Summary (from Full Text)
- **Topic**: Metadata-Optimized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Unified Study Summary
- **Aim**: Introduce a fully‑automated end‑to‑end RAG pipeline that uses LLM‑generated metadata for every document chunk and systematically evaluate how chunking, embedding, and metadata interact to improve enterprise knowledge‑base retrieval.
- **Rationale**: Prior RAG work improves performance but lacks a comprehensive study of how chunking granularity, embedding strategies, and metadata composition jointly affect retrieval quality. This paper fills that gap by providing a reproducible 3×3 experimental matrix and demonstrating that metadata enrichment consistently outperforms content‑only baselines.
- **Ground**: Dataset of 6,287 AWS S3 documentation pages (User Guide, API Reference, Glacier Developer Guide, On Outposts). Three chunking strategies (Naïve, Recursive, Semantic) produce 5,706 chunks. Three embedding strategies (Content‑only, TF‑IDF‑weighted, Prefix‑Fusion) are applied. Ground‑truth relevance is generated by a cross‑encoder reranker (BAAI/bge‑reranker‑base or Snowflake Arctic‑Embed τ=0.8).
- **Experiment**: Nine configurations (3 chunking × 3 embeddings) are evaluated on top‑k retrieval (k=50) using cosine similarity. Metrics include Precision@10, HitRate@10, MRR@10, NDCG@10, latency, and clustering quality. Results show Recursive + TF‑IDF yields highest Precision@10 (82.5%) and NDCG@10 (0.807); Naïve + Prefix‑Fusion achieves best HitRate@10 (0.925); TF‑IDF weighted embeddings provide tight clustering and lowest latency; Semantic chunking does not improve metrics.
- **Takeaway**: LLM‑generated metadata, combined with judicious chunking and advanced embeddings, delivers measurable gains in RAG retrieval performance for enterprise knowledge bases. The study offers a reproducible, end‑to‑end pipeline and concrete guidance for deploying high‑quality, scalable knowledge‑management systems, while outlining future research directions such as real‑time metadata validation and multimodal adaptation.

#### Abstract
> In enterprise settings, efficiently retrieving relevant information from large and complex knowledge bases is essential for operational productivity and informed decision-making. This research presents a systematic framework for metadata enrichment using large language models (LLMs) to enhance document retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our approach employs a comprehensive, structured pipeline that dynamically generates meaningful metadata for document segments, substantially improving their semantic representations and retrieval accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we compare three chunking strategies-semantic, recursive, and naive-and evaluate their effectiveness when combined with advanced embedding techniques. The results demonstrate that metadata-enriched approaches consistently outperform content-only baselines, with recursive chunking paired with TF-IDF weighted embeddings yielding an 82.5% precision rate compared to 73.3% for semantic content-only approaches. The naive chunking strategy with prefix-fusion achieved the highest Hit Rate@10 of 0.925. Our evaluation employs cross-encoder reranking for ground truth generation, enabling rigorous assessment via Hit Rate and Metadata Consistency metrics. These findings confirm that metadata enrichment enhances vector clustering quality while reducing retrieval latency, making it a key optimization for RAG systems across knowledge domains. This work offers practical insights for deploying high-performance, scalable document retrieval solutions in enterprise settings, demonstrating that metadata enrichment is a powerful approach for enhancing RAG effectiveness.

### 2. The Effect of Document Summarization on LLM-Based Relevance Judgments

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 14
- **Authors**: Samaneh Mohtadi, Kevin Roitero, Stefano Mizzaro, Gianluca Demartini
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05334v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-05 00:26:13

While the focus is not on e-commerce, the general IR principles and methods are applicable to various domains.

#### Abstract
> Relevance judgments are central to the evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) systems, but obtaining them from human annotators is costly and time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as automated assessors, showing promising alignment with human annotations. Most prior studies have treated documents as fixed units, feeding their full content directly to LLM assessors. We investigate how text summarization affects the reliability of LLM-based judgments and their downstream impact on IR evaluation. Using state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple TREC collections, we compare judgments made from full documents with those based on LLM-generated summaries of different lengths. We examine their agreement with human labels, their effect on retrieval effectiveness evaluation, and their influence on IR systems' ranking stability. Our findings show that summary-based judgments achieve comparable stability in systems' ranking to full-document judgments, while introducing systematic shifts in label distributions and biases that vary by model and dataset. These results highlight summarization as both an opportunity for more efficient large-scale IR evaluation and a methodological choice with important implications for the reliability of automatic judgments.

### 3. Optimizing Medical Question-Answering Systems: A Comparative Study of Fine-Tuned and Zero-Shot Large Language Models with RAG Framework

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Tasnimul Hassan, Md Faisal Karim, Haziq Jeelani, Elham Behnam, Robert Green, Fayeq Jeelani Syed
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05863v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-05 16:38:47
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval, rank
- **Reason**: This paper is highly relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of query understanding and ranking models. The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to improve factual accuracy and reduce hallucinations in medical question-answering systems aligns with your focus on deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization. However, the specific domain of medical question-answering is somewhat outside your primary e-commerce focus.

#### Abstract
> Medical question-answering (QA) systems can benefit from advances in large language models (LLMs), but directly applying LLMs to the clinical domain poses challenges such as maintaining factual accuracy and avoiding hallucinations. In this paper, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based medical QA system that combines domain-specific knowledge retrieval with open-source LLMs to answer medical questions. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art open LLMs (LLaMA~2 and Falcon) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient domain specialization. The system retrieves relevant medical literature to ground the LLM's answers, thereby improving factual correctness and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the approach on benchmark datasets (PubMedQA and MedMCQA) and show that retrieval augmentation yields measurable improvements in answer accuracy compared to using LLMs alone. Our fine-tuned LLaMA~2 model achieves 71.8% accuracy on PubMedQA, substantially improving over the 55.4% zero-shot baseline, while maintaining transparency by providing source references. We also detail the system design and fine-tuning methodology, demonstrating that grounding answers in retrieved evidence reduces unsupported content by approximately 60%. These results highlight the potential of RAG-augmented open-source LLMs for reliable biomedical QA, pointing toward practical clinical informatics applications.

### 4. Retrieving Semantically Similar Decisions under Noisy Institutional Labels: Robust Comparison of Embedding Methods

- **LLM Score**: 6
- **Keyword Score**: 6
- **Authors**: Tereza Novotna, Jakub Harasta
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05681v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-05 12:54:26
- **Comment**: The manuscript has been accepted for presentation as a short paper at the 38th International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems (JURIX 2025) in Torino, Italy
- **Topic Keywords**: query, relevance
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of query understanding and ranking models. However, the focus on case law retrieval and embedding methods for Czech Constitutional Court decisions is somewhat niche and not directly aligned with your primary interests in e-commerce and deep semantic understanding. The paper's emphasis on robust comparison and noise-aware evaluation is relevant to your interests in real-time relevance optimization, but the connection is not strong enough to warrant a higher score.

#### Abstract
> Retrieving case law is a time-consuming task predominantly carried out by querying databases. We provide a comparison of two models in three different settings for Czech Constitutional Court decisions: (i) a large general-purpose embedder (OpenAI), (ii) a domain-specific BERT-trained from scratch on ~30,000 decisions using sliding windows and attention pooling. We propose a noise-aware evaluation including IDF-weighted keyword overlap as graded relevance, binarization via two thresholds (0.20 balanced, 0.28 strict), significance via paired bootstrap, and an nDCG diagnosis supported with qualitative analysis. Despite modest absolute nDCG (expected under noisy labels), the general OpenAI embedder decisively outperforms the domain pre-trained BERT in both settings at @10/@20/@100 across both thresholds; differences are statistically significant. Diagnostics attribute low absolutes to label drift and strong ideals rather than lack of utility. Additionally, our framework is robust enough to be used for evaluation under a noisy gold dataset, which is typical when handling data with heterogeneous labels stemming from legacy judicial databases.

### 5. Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Entity Linking for Educational Platforms

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 11
- **Authors**: Francesco Granata, Francesco Poggi, Misael Mongiovì
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05967v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-05 18:59:18
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, relevance, rag, retrieval, rank
- **Reason**: The paper explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which is related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on educational platforms and entity linking is somewhat specific and not directly aligned with the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures are gaining significant attention for their ability to ground language generation in reliable knowledge sources. Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance. This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian. The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker. Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset. Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset. These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation. They also demonstrate the potential of entity-aware RAG systems in educational environments, fostering adaptive and reliable AI-based tutoring tools.

### 6. Active Video Perception: Iterative Evidence Seeking for Agentic Long Video Understanding

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 8

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05774v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-05 15:03:48
- **Comment**: Website: https://activevideoperception.github.io/
- **Topic Keywords**: query, queries, rag
- **Reason**: The paper explores Active Video Perception for Long Video Understanding, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and query understanding. However, the focus on video understanding and perception is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes in IR and Search technologies. The use of deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization is not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, limiting the paper's relevance to the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> Long video understanding (LVU) is challenging because answering real-world queries often depends on sparse, temporally dispersed cues buried in hours of mostly redundant and irrelevant content. While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.

### 7. ArtistMus: A Globally Diverse, Artist-Centric Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Music Question Answering

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 8

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05430v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-05 05:09:30
- **Comment**: Submitted to LREC 2026. This work is an evolution of our earlier preprint arXiv:2507.23334
- **Topic Keywords**: information retrieval, rag, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: The paper is somewhat relevant to your research interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, as it explores music-related question answering and retrieval-augmented generation. However, the focus on music information retrieval and domain-specific question answering is not a central match to your primary interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have transformed open-domain question answering, yet their effectiveness in music-related reasoning remains limited due to sparse music knowledge in pretraining data. While music information retrieval and computational musicology have explored structured and multimodal understanding, few resources support factual and contextual music question answering (MQA) grounded in artist metadata or historical context. We introduce MusWikiDB, a vector database of 3.2M passages from 144K music-related Wikipedia pages, and ArtistMus, a benchmark of 1,000 questions on 500 diverse artists with metadata such as genre, debut year, and topic. These resources enable systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for MQA. Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus. We release MusWikiDB and ArtistMus to advance research in music information retrieval and domain-specific question answering, establishing a foundation for retrieval-augmented reasoning in culturally rich domains such as music.

### 8. M4-RAG: A Massive-Scale Multilingual Multi-Cultural Multimodal RAG

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 7

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05959v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-05 18:55:58
- **Comment**: Preprint
- **Topic Keywords**: query, rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of vision-language models, which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the focus on vision-language models and multimodal RAG is not a central match to the user's primary research interests in text-based IR and search technologies. The paper's emphasis on multilingual and multimodal aspects also diverges from the user's focus on e-commerce and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance in visual question answering (VQA), yet they remain constrained by static training data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this limitation by enabling access to up-to-date, culturally grounded, and multilingual information; however, multilingual multimodal RAG remains largely underexplored. We introduce M4-RAG, a massive-scale benchmark covering 42 languages and 56 regional dialects and registers, comprising over 80,000 culturally diverse image-question pairs for evaluating retrieval-augmented VQA across languages and modalities. To balance realism with reproducibility, we build a controlled retrieval environment containing millions of carefully curated multilingual documents relevant to the query domains, approximating real-world retrieval conditions while ensuring consistent experimentation. Our systematic evaluation reveals that although RAG consistently benefits smaller VLMs, it fails to scale to larger models and often even degrades their performance, exposing a critical mismatch between model size and current retrieval effectiveness. M4-RAG provides a foundation for advancing next-generation RAG systems capable of reasoning seamlessly across languages, modalities, and cultural contexts.

### 9. Ontology Learning with LLMs: A Benchmark Study on Axiom Identification

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05594v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-05 10:28:56
- **Comment**: Submitted to Semantic Web Journal, under review
- **Topic Keywords**: query, queries
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to the user's interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), but it does not directly align with their primary focus on Information Retrieval (IR) and query understanding. The paper's focus on ontology learning and axiom identification is not a central match for the user's research themes.

#### Abstract
> Ontologies are an important tool for structuring domain knowledge, but their development is a complex task that requires significant modelling and domain expertise. Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies.

### 10. Natural Language Summarization Enables Multi-Repository Bug Localization by LLMs in Microservice Architectures

- **Submitted**: 2025-12-05 17:42:09
- **Comment**: Accepted at LLM4Code Workshop, ICSE 2026
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of natural language processing and search technologies. However, its focus on bug localization and microservice architectures is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes. The use of Learning to Rank and click models is not mentioned, which further reduces the relevance.

#### Abstract
> Bug localization in multi-repository microservice architectures is challenging due to the semantic gap between natural language bug reports and code, LLM context limitations, and the need to first identify the correct repository. We propose reframing this as a natural language reasoning task by transforming codebases into hierarchical NL summaries and performing NL-to-NL search instead of cross-modal retrieval. Our approach builds context-aware summaries at file, directory, and repository levels, then uses a two-phase search: first routing bug reports to relevant repositories, then performing top-down localization within those repositories. Evaluated on DNext, an industrial system with 46 repositories and 1.1M lines of code, our method achieves Pass@10 of 0.82 and MRR of 0.50, significantly outperforming retrieval baselines and agentic RAG systems like GitHub Copilot and Cursor. This work demonstrates that engineered natural language representations can be more effective than raw source code for scalable bug localization, providing an interpretable repository -> directory -> file search path, which is vital for building trust in enterprise AI tools by providing essential transparency.

### 11. A Greek Government Decisions Dataset for Public-Sector Analysis and Insight

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Giorgos Antoniou, Giorgos Filandrianos, Aggelos Vlachos, Giorgos Stamou, Lampros Kollimenos, Konstantinos Skianis, Michalis Vazirgiannis

- **Submitted**: 2025-12-05 11:47:33
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper introduces a dataset for public-sector analysis, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and NLP, but the focus is more on data mining and corpus creation. While it touches on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and structured retrieval, the context is specific to governmental documents and transparency, which is not a central match to the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> We introduce an open, machine-readable corpus of Greek government decisions sourced from the national transparency platform Diavgeia. The resource comprises 1 million decisions, featuring and high-quality raw text extracted from PDFs. It is released with raw extracted text in Markdown format, alongside a fully reproducible extraction pipeline. Beyond the core dataset, we conduct qualitative analyses to explore boilerplate patterns and design a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) task by formulating a set of representative questions, creating high-quality answers, and evaluating a baseline RAG system on its ability to retrieve and reason over public decisions. This evaluation demonstrates the potential of large-scale public-sector corpora to support advanced information access and transparency through structured retrieval and reasoning over governmental documents, and highlights how such a RAG pipeline could simulate a chat-based assistant capable of interactively answering questions about public decisions. Due to its scale, quality, and domain coverage, the corpus can also serve as high-value pre-training or fine-tuning material for new Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) respectively, including specialized models for legal and governmental domains, and as a foundation for novel approaches in domain adaptation, knowledge-grounded generation, and explainable AI. Finally, we discuss limitations, outline future directions, and make both the data and the code accessible.

### 12. Structured Reasoning with Tree-of-Thoughts for Bengali Math Word Problems

- **Submitted**: 2025-12-05 10:07:08
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep semantic understanding, but it focuses on a specific task (math word problems) and language (Bengali), which is not central to your research themes. While it explores structured reasoning methods, it's not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or query understanding.

#### Abstract
> Mathematical Word Problems (MWPs) are among the most challenging tasks in natural language processing because they require both linguistic understanding and multi-step numerical reasoning. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise, its linear structure often propagates errors, limiting overall effectiveness. To address this limitation, we present the a systematic study of Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning for Bengali MWPs using the SOMADHAN dataset. Owing to computational and token-cost constraints, we evaluate a curated set of 100 representative problems across multiple large language models (LLMs), including GPT-OSS and LLaMA variants, under standard prompting, CoT, and ToT strategies. Our results show that CoT improves baseline accuracy from 78% (standard prompting) to 83% on average, while ToT further increases performance by up to 5 percentage points, achieving 88% accuracy with GPT-OSS-120B. These improvements highlight that ToT is particularly effective in medium-to-large-scale models but may offer less advantage for smaller ones. Overall, our findings establish ToT as a robust framework for solving mathematical problems in low-resource languages such as Bengali. More broadly, this study shows that structured reasoning methods like ToT can provide more reliable and globally consistent outcomes than CoT, paving the way for better reasoning strategies in multilingual NLP.

### 13. Learning from Self Critique and Refinement for Faithful LLM Summarization

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05387v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-12-05 02:59:43
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on improving the faithfulness of Large Language Model (LLM) summarization, which is a specific application of Natural Language Processing (NLP). While it touches on query understanding and ranking models indirectly, its primary contribution is in the area of NLP, specifically in the context of LLMs and summarization. It does not directly relate to information retrieval or search technologies, but its techniques could potentially be applied to other areas of NLP.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucinations: output content that is not grounded in the input context, when performing long-form text generation tasks such as summarization. Prior works have shown that hallucinations can be reduced by iteratively critiquing and refining previously generated outputs using either the same model or a more powerful teacher model as the critique. However, these approaches either require additional test-time compute or assume access to more powerful teacher models, making them costly and less practical. In this work, we propose Self Critique and Refinement-based Preference Optimization (SCRPO), which is a self-supervised training framework that first constructs a preference dataset by leveraging the LLM's own critique and refinement capabilities, and then applies preference learning to improve the same LLM for faithful summarization. Experiments on three summarization benchmarks (XSUM CNNDM and SAMSum), demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods in terms of faithfulness metrics while either maintaining or improving other metrics that measure the overall quality of the summary. Moreover, compared to test-time refinement, our approach not only improves efficiency but also results in more faithful summaries.

- **Comment**: Under Review
- **Topic Keywords**: retrieval
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to the user's interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and query understanding, but it primarily focuses on medical question answering and large language models, which is not a central match for the user's research themes. The paper's use of retrieval-augmented generation and in-context learning is somewhat relevant to the user's interests in ranking models and query understanding, but the application is specific to the medical domain.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have recently demonstrated strong potential in medical Question Answering (QA). Existing approaches are largely English-focused and primarily rely on distillation from general-purpose LLMs, raising concerns about the reliability of their medical knowledge. In this work, we present a method to generate multilingual reasoning traces grounded in factual medical knowledge. We produce 500k traces in English, Italian, and Spanish, using a retrievalaugmented generation approach over medical information from Wikipedia. The traces are generated to solve medical questions drawn from MedQA and MedMCQA, which we extend to Italian and Spanish. We test our pipeline in both in-domain and outof-domain settings across Medical QA benchmarks, and demonstrate that our reasoning traces improve performance both when utilized via in-context learning (few-shot) and supervised fine-tuning, yielding state-of-the-art results among 8B-parameter LLMs. We believe that these resources can support the development of safer, more transparent clinical decision-support tools in multilingual settings. We release the full suite of resources: reasoning traces, translated QA datasets, Medical-Wikipedia, and fine-tuned models.

#### Abstract
> In the past decade a surge in the amount of electronic health record (EHR) data in the United States, attributed to a favorable policy environment created by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 and the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016. Clinical notes for patients' assessments, diagnoses, and treatments are captured in these EHRs in free-form text by physicians, who spend a considerable amount of time entering and editing them. Manually writing clinical notes takes a considerable amount of a doctor's valuable time, increasing the patient's waiting time and possibly delaying diagnoses. Large language models (LLMs) possess the ability to generate news articles that closely resemble human-written ones. We investigate the usage of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt engineering to improve the LLM's response in clinical note generation. In our prompts, we use as input International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and basic patient information. We investigate a strategy that combines the traditional CoT with semantic search results to improve the quality of generated clinical notes. Additionally, we infuse a knowledge graph (KG) built from clinical ontology to further enrich the domain-specific knowledge of generated clinical notes. We test our prompting technique on six clinical cases from the CodiEsp test dataset using GPT-4 and our results show that it outperformed the clinical notes generated by standard one-shot prompts.

#### Abstract
> How many mistakes do published AI papers contain? Peer-reviewed publications form the foundation upon which new research and knowledge are built. Errors that persist in the literature can propagate unnoticed, creating confusion in follow-up studies and complicating reproducibility. The accelerating pace of research and the increasing demands on the peer-review system make such mistakes harder to detect and avoid. To address this, we developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify mistakes in papers previously published at top AI conferences and journals. Our analysis focuses on objective mistakes-e.g., errors in formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables-that have a clearly verifiable ground truth. We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%. While most identified issues are relatively minor, correcting them would reduce confusion in the literature and strengthen reproducibility. The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results. Moreover, we show that the AI Checker can propose correct fixes for 75.8% of the identified mistakes. Overall, this study highlights the potential of frontier LLMs to detect and correct objective mistakes in published papers, helping to establish a firmer foundation of knowledge.

#### Abstract
> Over the past four decades, artificial intelligence (AI) research has flourished at the nexus of academia and industry. However, Big Tech companies have increasingly acquired the edge in computational resources, big data, and talent. So far, it has been largely unclear how many papers the industry funds, how their citation impact compares to non-funded papers, and what drives industry interest. This study fills that gap by quantifying the number of industry-funded papers at 10 top AI conferences (e.g., ICLR, CVPR, AAAI, ACL) and their citation influence. We analyze about 49.8K papers, about 1.8M citations from AI papers to other papers, and about 2.3M citations from other papers to AI papers from 1998-2022 in Scopus. Through seven research questions, we examine the volume and evolution of industry funding in AI research, the citation impact of funded papers, the diversity and temporal range of their citations, and the subfields in which industry predominantly acts. Our findings reveal that industry presence has grown markedly since 2015, from less than 2 percent to more than 11 percent in 2020. Between 2018 and 2022, 12 percent of industry-funded papers achieved high citation rates as measured by the h5-index, compared to 4 percent of non-industry-funded papers and 2 percent of non-funded papers. Top AI conferences engage more with industry-funded research than non-funded research, as measured by our newly proposed metric, the Citation Preference Ratio (CPR). We show that industry-funded research is increasingly insular, citing predominantly other industry-funded papers while referencing fewer non-funded papers. These findings reveal new trends in AI research funding, including a shift towards more industry-funded papers and their growing citation impact, greater insularity of industry-funded work than non-funded work, and a preference of industry-funded research to cite recent work.

#### Abstract
> Grounding is a fundamental capability for building graphical user interface (GUI) agents. Although existing approaches rely on large-scale bounding box supervision, they still face various challenges, such as cross-platform generalization, complex layout analysis, and fine-grained element localization. In this paper, we investigate zoom as a strong yet underexplored prior for GUI grounding, and propose a training-free method, ZoomClick. By characterizing four key properties of zoom (i.e., pre-zoom, depth, shrink size, minimal crop size), we unlock its full capabilities for dynamic spatial focusing and adaptive context switching. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performance of both general vision-language and specialized GUI grounding models, achieving state-of-the-art results on several mainstream benchmarks; for example, UI-Venus-72B attains a 73.1% success rate on ScreenSpot-Pro. Furthermore, we present GUIZoom-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating model adaptability to zoom, aiming to inspire future research on improving zoom for further training and test-time scaling in GUI grounding tasks.

#### Abstract
> The significant gap between rising demands for clinical training and the scarcity of expert instruction poses a major challenge to medical education. With powerful capabilities in personalized guidance, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to bridge this gap. However, current research focuses mainly on one-on-one knowledge instruction, overlooking collaborative reasoning, a key skill for students developed in teamwork like ward rounds. To this end, we develop ClinEdu, a multi-agent pedagogical simulator with personality-driven patients and diverse student cohorts, enabling controlled testing of complex pedagogical processes and scalable generation of teaching data. Based on ClinEdu, we construct ClinTeach, a large Socratic teaching dialogue dataset that captures the complexities of group instruction. We then train MedTutor-R1, the first multimodal Socratic tutor designed for one-to-many instruction in clinical medical education. MedTutor-R1 is first instruction-tuned on our ClinTeach dataset and then optimized with reinforcement learning, using rewards derived from a three-axis rubric, covering structural fidelity, analytical quality, and clinical safety, to refine its adaptive Socratic strategies. For authentic in-situ assessment, we use simulation-based interactive evaluation that redeploys the tutor back into ClinEdu. Experimental results demonstrate that our MedTutor-R1 outperforms the base model by over 20% in average pedagogical score and is comparable to o3, while also exhibiting high adaptability in handling a varying number of students. This promising performance underscores the effectiveness of our pedagogical simulator, ClinEdu.

The focus on language model evaluation and bias mitigation in language models does not align with your interests in query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Language models (LMs) judges are widely used to evaluate the quality of LM outputs. Despite many advantages, LM judges display concerning biases that can impair their integrity in evaluations. One such bias is self-preference: LM judges preferring their own answers over those produced by other LMs or humans. The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers. Our findings suggest that self-recognition and self-preference can happen on many semantic levels, and complete mitigation remains challenging despite promising initial results.

While it touches on NLP capabilities, the context is more aligned with AI alignment and AGI, which is not a central theme in the user's research interests.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically aligned with human values using preference data or predefined principles such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness. However, as AI systems progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), such value systems may become insufficient. In addition, human feedback-based alignment remains resource-intensive and difficult to scale. While AI-feedback-based self-improving alignment methods have been explored as a scalable alternative, they have largely remained constrained to conventional alignment values. In this work, we explore both a more holistic alignment objective and a scalable, self-improving alignment approach. Aiming to transcend conventional alignment norms, we introduce Collective Agency (CA)-a unified and open-ended alignment value that encourages integrated agentic capabilities. We also propose Dynamic Alignment-an alignment framework that enables an LLM to iteratively align itself. Dynamic Alignment comprises two key components: (1) automated training dataset generation with LLMs, and (2) a self-rewarding mechanism, where the policy model evaluates its own output candidates and assigns rewards for GRPO-based learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully aligns the model to CA while preserving general NLP capabilities.

#### Abstract
> Prompt engineering has emerged as a useful way studying the algorithmic tendencies and biases of large language models. Meanwhile creatives and academics have leveraged LLMs to develop creative works and explore the boundaries of their writing capabilities through text generation and code. This study suggests that creative text prompting, specifically Poetry Prompt Patterns, may be a useful addition to the toolbox of the prompt engineer, and outlines the process by which this approach may be taken. Then, the paper uses poetic prompts to assess descriptions and evaluations of three models of a renowned poet and test the consequences of the willingness of models to adapt or rewrite original creative works for presumed audiences.
