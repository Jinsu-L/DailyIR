        "abstract": "We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.",

        "abstract": "Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.",

We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \\textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.",

        "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly capable of producing creative texts, yet most studies on AI-generated poetry focus on English -- a language that dominates training data. In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech. The results suggest that readers' beliefs about authorship and the aesthetic evaluation of the poem are interconnected.",

In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning. Together, these results yield practical guidelines for integrating metadata to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining.",

We correlate neuron activations with auxiliary metrics -- such as external labels and the model's own confidence score -- thereby uncovering interpretable and task-specific behaviors without the need for manual token aggregation. We empirically validate our method on tasks spanning open-ended text generation and natural language inference, demonstrating its ability to detect neurons that not only drive known skills but also reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.",

To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models.

        "abstract": "Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.",

These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction.

Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods.

Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.",

        "abstract": "The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.",

        "abstract": "Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \\textbf{D}ual-\\textbf{S}tate \\textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\\% on BIRD development set.

To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.",

        "abstract": "Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected \"thoughts\" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting \"thoughts\" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether \"training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences.\" We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.",

        "abstract": "Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.",

Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.",

In this paper, we propose RIA (Ranking-Infused Architecture), a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates pointwise and listwise evaluation. RIA introduces four key components: (1) the User and Candidate DualTransformer (UCDT) for fine-grained user-item-context modeling; (2) the Context-aware User History and Target (CUHT) module for position-sensitive preference learning; (3) the Listwise Multi-HSTU (LMH) module to capture hierarchical item dependencies; and (4) the Embedding Cache (EC) module to bridge efficiency and effectiveness during inference. By sharing representations across ranking and reranking, RIA enables rich contextual knowledge transfer while maintaining low latency. Extensive experiments show that RIA outperforms state-of-the-art models on both public and industrial datasets, achieving significant gains in AUC and LogLoss. Deployed in Meituan advertising system, RIA yields a +1.69% improvement in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and a +4.54% increase in Cost Per Mille (CPM) in online A/B tests.",

This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity.

        "abstract": "We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.",

Concerningly, we find that 88\\% of the generated stories contain one or more cultural inaccuracies, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. Lastly, we transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of foundational models. Through this evaluation, we surprisingly discover that models often possess the requisite cultural knowledge despite generating stories rife with cultural misrepresentations.",

Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.",

        "abstract": "There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.",

        "abstract": "Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., \"shape\", \"color\"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation.

        "abstract": "Document centric RAG pipelines usually begin with OCR, followed by brittle heuristics for chunking, table parsing, and layout reconstruction. These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment.\n  We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking.\n  VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA. These results show that OCR free, summary guided multimodal retrieval is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional text extraction pipelines.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.",

We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography (\"data\", \"poop\", \"loll\": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.",

        "abstract": "Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \\emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \\emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

        "abstract": "As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.",

In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.",

        "abstract": "The scarcity of parallel speech corpora critically hampers speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), often forcing reliance on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This paper introduces RosettaSpeech, a novel and simplified framework for zero-shot S2ST that is trained on monolingual speech-text data augmented by machine translation supervision. While our method leverages the linguistic knowledge inherent in text-based NMT models, it strictly eliminates the need for parallel speech-to-speech pairs. Our model uniquely uses text as an intermediate bridge during training but functions as a direct, end-to-end speech-to-speech model at inference. This streamlined approach achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. For instance, on the CVSS-C test set, RosettaSpeech outperforms leading systems, achieving an ASR-BLEU score of 25.17 for German-to-English and 29.86 for Spanish-to-English-relative gains of over 27% and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a single model can deliver strong many-to-one translation performance (FR/ES/DE -> EN). We also provide a foundational analysis of how training data scaling impacts model performance. By prioritizing reliance on abundant parallel text rather than difficult-to-acquire parallel speech, RosettaSpeech offers a scalable path to creating high-quality, speaker-preserving S2ST for a much broader array of languages.",

However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices.\n  In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the LLM backbone.",

Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.",

        "abstract": "Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.",

It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \\citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\\% on the English test set and 50.7\\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\\% on English and 69.3\\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\\%.

Yet despite its growing importance, current GEO practices are ad hoc, and their impacts remain poorly understood, especially in e-commerce. We address this gap by introducing E-GEO, the first benchmark built specifically for e-commerce GEO. E-GEO contains over 7,000 realistic, multi-sentence consumer product queries paired with relevant listings, capturing rich intent, constraints, preferences, and shopping contexts that existing datasets largely miss. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of e-commerce GEO, evaluating 15 common rewriting heuristics and comparing their empirical performance. To move beyond heuristics, we further formulate GEO as a tractable optimization problem and develop a lightweight iterative prompt-optimization algorithm that can significantly outperform these baselines. Surprisingly, the optimized prompts reveal a stable, domain-agnostic pattern--suggesting the existence of a \"universally effective\" GEO strategy.

In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.",

Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval.

Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\\%, 17.2\\%, and 18.5\\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\\%, 12.7\\%, and 13.7\\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\\% at inference.",

        "title": "Structured Prompting Enables More Robust, Holistic Evaluation of Language Models",
        "abstract": "As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).",

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

        "title": "Memories Retrieved from Many Paths: A Multi-Prefix Framework for Robust Detection of Training Data Leakage in Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.",
