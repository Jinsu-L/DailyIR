#### Abstract
> Query rewriting is a fundamental technique in information retrieval (IR). It
typically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the
query and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and
relevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its
vector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging
top-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed
based on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are
relevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed
specifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language
models (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free
query reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again,
relies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting
quality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed
framework: \textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which
performs model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents,
not only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the
relevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training
pipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy
feedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers
demonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing
it as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.

### 3. Model-Document Protocol for AI Search

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160v2>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-29 04:29:17
- **Comment**: 10 pages
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval, search
- **Reason**: This paper aligns well with your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in query understanding and ranking models. The Model-Document Protocol (MDP) framework presented in the paper addresses the challenge of linking large language models with unstructured documents, which is a key area of interest in your research. The paper's focus on transforming unstructured documents into task-specific, LLM-ready inputs is also relevant to your work on query understanding and ranking models.

#### Abstract
> AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

### 4. TOPol: Capturing and Explaining Multidimensional Semantic Polarity Fields and Vectors

- **LLM Score**: 8
- **Keyword Score**: 2
- **Authors**: Gabin Taibi, Lucia Gomez
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25069v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-29 01:14:21
- **Comment**: 7 pages, 3 figures and 2 tables
- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper aligns well with your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the area of query understanding and ranking models. The paper's focus on semantic polarity and multidimensional discourse analysis is also relevant to your interests in Natural Language Processing and deep semantic understanding.

#### Abstract
> Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

### 5. GReF: A Unified Generative Framework for Efficient Reranking via Ordered Multi-token Prediction

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 9
- **Authors**: Zhijie Lin, Zhuofeng Li, Chenglei Dai, Wentian Bao, Shuai Lin, Enyun Yu, Haoxiang Zhang, Liang Zhao
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25220v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-29 06:54:42
- **Comment**: Accepted by CIKM 2025
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, rerank, recommend, rank, search
- **Reason**: The paper discusses a unified generative framework for efficient reranking, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the focus is on recommender systems and multi-stage recommendation systems, which is not the primary area of interest. The use of deep learning models and sequence-level evaluation is relevant to the user's background in NLP and data mining, but the application is more specific to recommender systems.

#### Abstract
> In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in
modeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring
optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent
research follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator
produces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In
practice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.
However, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the
separation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,
autoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we
propose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address
the two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an
autoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic
autoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we
pre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter
initialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating
sequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we
propose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient
autoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),
which trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items
while preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time
recommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF
outperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is
nearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also
been deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily
active users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.

### 6. Seeing Through the MiRAGE: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 8
- **Authors**: Alexander Martin, William Walden, Reno Kriz, Dengjia Zhang, Kate Sanders, Eugene Yang, Chihsheng Jin, Benjamin Van Durme
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24870v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-28 18:21:19
- **Comment**: https://github.com/alexmartin1722/mirage
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, retrieval augmented generation, retrieval, acl
- **Reason**: This paper introduces a framework for evaluating multimodal retrieval-augmented generation, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, its focus on multimodal sources and generation is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes, such as query understanding and ranking models. The paper's relevance is somewhat enhanced by its mention of evaluation metrics, which is a related topic in IR.

#### Abstract
> We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

### 7. Retrieval-Augmented Search for Large-Scale Map Collections with ColPali

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Jamie Mahowald, Benjamin Charles Germain Lee
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25718v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-29 17:27:21
- **Comment**: 5 pages, 5 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: query, retrieval, search, www
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, particularly in the context of multimodal search and retrieval-augmented search systems.

#### Abstract
> Multimodal approaches have shown great promise for searching and navigating
digital collections held by libraries, archives, and museums. In this paper, we
introduce map-RAS: a retrieval-augmented search system for historic maps. In
addition to introducing our framework, we detail our publicly-hosted demo for
searching 101,233 map images held by the Library of Congress. With our system,
users can multimodally query the map collection via ColPali, summarize search
results using Llama 3.2, and upload their own collections to perform
inter-collection search. We articulate potential use cases for archivists,
curators, and end-users, as well as future work with our system in both machine
learning and the digital humanities. Our demo can be viewed at:

### 8. FARSIQA: Faithful and Advanced RAG System for Islamic Question Answering

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 7
- **Authors**: Mohammad Aghajani Asl, Behrooz Minaei Bidgoli
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25621v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-29 15:25:34
- **Comment**: 37 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables. Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation (RAG), Question Answering (QA), Islamic Knowledge Base, Faithful
  AI, Persian NLP, Multi-hop Reasoning, Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Topic Keywords**: queries, rag, retrieval
- **Reason**: The paper FARSIQA is somewhat related to your research interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and query understanding, but it focuses on a specific domain (Islamic question answering) and application (retrieval-augmented generation). While it involves complex query processing and evidence aggregation, it does not directly relate to your primary focus on information retrieval, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

### 9. The Tool Decathlon: Benchmarking Language Agents for Diverse, Realistic, and Long-Horizon Task Execution

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 6

- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25726v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-29 17:32:49
- **Comment**: Website: https://toolathlon.xyz/
- **Topic Keywords**: query, rag, commerce
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on benchmarking language agents for diverse, long-horizon task execution, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the primary focus on language agents and task execution does not directly align with the user's core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

### 10. Revisiting scalable sequential recommendation with Multi-Embedding Approach and Mixture-of-Experts

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Qiushi Pan, Hao Wang, Guoyuan An, Luankang Zhang, Wei Guo, Yong Liu
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25285v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-29 08:42:15
- **Topic Keywords**: relevance, recommend, search
- **Reason**: This paper is somewhat related to your research interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies, but it focuses more on recommender systems and sequential recommendation. While it explores a novel approach to addressing challenges in recommendation models, it doesn't directly align with your primary focus on query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> In recommendation systems, how to effectively scale up recommendation models
has been an essential research topic. While significant progress has been made
in developing advanced and scalable architectures for sequential
recommendation(SR) models, there are still challenges due to items'
multi-faceted characteristics and dynamic item relevance in the user context.
To address these issues, we propose Fuxi-MME, a framework that integrates a
multi-embedding strategy with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.
Specifically, to efficiently capture diverse item characteristics in a
decoupled manner, we decompose the conventional single embedding matrix into
several lower-dimensional embedding matrices. Additionally, by substituting
relevant parameters in the Fuxi Block with an MoE layer, our model achieves
adaptive and specialized transformation of the enriched representations.
Empirical results on public datasets show that our proposed framework
outperforms several competitive baselines.

### 11. Emergence of Minimal Circuits for Indirect Object Identification in Attention-Only Transformers

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 5
- **Authors**: Rabin Adhikari
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25013v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-28 22:25:19
- **Comment**: 9 pages, 10 figures
- **Topic Keywords**: query, ctr
- **Reason**: This paper explores the interpretability of transformer models, specifically focusing on the emergence of minimal circuits for indirect object identification. While it touches on aspects of deep semantic understanding, its primary focus is on the computational foundations of transformer reasoning, which is somewhat related to your interests in information retrieval and NLP. However, the paper's emphasis on interpretability and minimal circuits is not directly aligned with your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

### 12. Interpreting LLMs as Credit Risk Classifiers: Do Their Feature Explanations Align with Classical ML?

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Saeed AlMarri, Kristof Juhasz, Mathieu Ravaut, Gautier Marti, Hamdan Al Ahbabi, Ibrahim Elfadel
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25701v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-29 17:05:00
- **Comment**: 8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, CIKM 2025 FinFAI workshop
- **Topic Keywords**: ranking, rank
- **Reason**: This paper explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a financial risk assessment task, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the focus on explainability and feature attribution is more aligned with NLP and data mining, but not directly related to the user's core research themes of query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

### 13. Continual Low-Rank Adapters for LLM-based Generative Recommender Systems

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 4
- **Authors**: Hyunsik Yoo, Ting-Wei Li, SeongKu Kang, Zhining Liu, Charlie Xu, Qilin Qi, Hanghang Tong
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25093v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-29 01:57:38
- **Topic Keywords**: user behavior, recommend, rank
- **Reason**: The paper focuses on continual learning for recommender systems using large language models, which is somewhat related to information retrieval and search technologies. However, the primary focus is on recommender systems, and the abstract does not mention query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, which are core areas of interest. The connection to IR is indirect, but the use of language models and adaptation techniques might be of interest to researchers with a broader scope.

#### Abstract
> While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

### 14. Implicature in Interaction: Understanding Implicature Improves Alignment in Human-LLM Interaction

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Asutosh Hota, Jussi P. P. Jokinen
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25426v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-29 11:49:42
- **Comment**: The manuscript is approximately 7360 words and contains 12 figures
  and 6 tables
- **Topic Keywords**: relevance
- **Reason**: The paper explores the intersection of human-computer interaction and NLP, specifically focusing on implicature and its impact on LLMs' ability to infer user intent. While it touches on aspects of query understanding and user behavior modeling, its primary focus is on HAI alignment, which is somewhat related to IR but not a central match for your research interests.

#### Abstract
> The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

### 15. GAPMAP: Mapping Scientific Knowledge Gaps in Biomedical Literature Using Large Language Models

- **LLM Score**: 4
- **Keyword Score**: 3
- **Authors**: Nourah M Salem, Elizabeth White, Michael Bada, Lawrence Hunter
- **URL**: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25055v1>
- **Submitted**: 2025-10-29 00:46:45
- **Topic Keywords**: rag, search
- **Reason**: The paper explores the application of large language models in identifying knowledge gaps in biomedical literature, which is somewhat related to the user's interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. However, the focus on biomedical literature and knowledge gaps is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes, such as query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

#### Abstract
> A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

- **Reason**: This paper explores a novel approach to scaling language models for reasoning tasks, which is somewhat related to my interests in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. However, the focus on scaling language models for reasoning and the use of looped language models does not directly align with my core research themes of query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

- **Reason**: The paper focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs) and persona simulation, which is somewhat related to query understanding and ranking models in Information Retrieval. However, the context is more aligned with Natural Language Processing and recommender systems, rather than search technologies or user behavior modeling. The paper's emphasis on LLMs and persona simulation does not directly relate to the user's core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

However, the focus on summarization and tagging, rather than query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling, limits its relevance to your core research interests.

#### Abstract
> This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

However, the focus on bibliographic recommendation and citation frequency as a proxy for training data redundancy is not directly aligned with the user's primary research interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

However, the focus on technology forecasting and entity extraction is not directly aligned with the user's primary research themes of query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models. While it touches on aspects of query understanding and ranking models, its primary focus is on leveraging answers to derive high-quality reasoning paths, which is somewhat related to user behavior modeling in information retrieval. However, the paper's emphasis on NLP and cognitive science aspects makes it more relevant to NLP and data mining than to core information retrieval themes.

#### Abstract
> Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

- **Reason**: The paper explores the application of large language models in research planning, which is related to information retrieval and NLP. However, the focus on research planning and its evaluation metrics does not directly align with the user's core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on recommender systems and Semantic IDs learning, which is somewhat related to your interests in Information Retrieval and Search technologies. However, the specific context of recommender systems and the emphasis on behavioral signals and multimodal information are not central to your core research themes.

#### Abstract
> Industrial recommender systems rely on unique Item Identifiers (ItemIDs).
However, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large,
dynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail data. Content-based Semantic IDs
(SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However,
by ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have
limited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral
information but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform
content features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,
creating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and
long-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise
Corruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative
noise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to
the loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The
equal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of
different behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to
distinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we
propose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,
Denoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior
modalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this
framework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive
behavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield
representations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical
signals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public
and large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant
superiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.

However, the focus is on domain-specific evaluation and bilingual understanding, which is not a central match to the user's core research themes of query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

However, the primary focus on proactive LLMs and dialogue agents does not directly align with the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and query understanding.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

While it involves dialogue generation and dataset creation, the focus is on psychiatric comorbidity and diagnostic dialogues, which is not a primary area of interest for the user.

#### Abstract
> Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

#### Abstract
> Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Codes are available at

- **Reason**: This paper appears to be unrelated to your core research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. The focus on autonomous agents, tool manipulation, and graph-based planning seems to be more aligned with Robotics or Artificial Intelligence, rather than your areas of expertise.

#### Abstract
> Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on sequential recommendation using graph signal processing, which is somewhat related to information retrieval, but primarily deals with recommender systems and does not align with the user's core research themes in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Recently, convolutional filters have been increasingly adopted in sequential
recommendation for their ability to capture local sequential patterns. However,
most of these models complement convolutional filters with self-attention. This
is because convolutional filters alone, generally fixed filters, struggle to
capture global interactions necessary for accurate recommendation. We propose
Time-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a
model inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters
capture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing
both fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec
achieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction
patterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for
self-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.
Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.

their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

The paper's emphasis on interpretive depth and autonomy is also not directly relevant to the user's interests in query understanding, ranking models, and user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

While it touches on retrieval and generation, it does not align with the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval, query understanding, ranking models, or user behavior modeling.

#### Abstract
> Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing
(NLP), enabling applications from content generation to decision support.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves LLMs by incorporating external
knowledge but also introduces security risks, particularly from data poisoning,
where the attacker injects poisoned texts into the knowledge database to
manipulate system outputs. While various defenses have been proposed, they
often struggle against advanced attacks. To address this, we introduce RAGuard,
a detection framework designed to identify poisoned texts. RAGuard first
expands the retrieval scope to increase the proportion of clean texts, reducing
the likelihood of retrieving poisoned content. It then applies chunk-wise
perplexity filtering to detect abnormal variations and text similarity
filtering to flag highly similar texts. This non-parametric approach enhances
RAG security, and experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate its
effectiveness in detecting and mitigating poisoning attacks, including strong
adaptive attacks.

While it involves NLP, the context is more aligned with computer vision and diagram generation, making it less relevant to your primary research interests.

#### Abstract
> Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

#### Abstract
> Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

While it involves language understanding and real-world applications, the context is more aligned with recommender systems and business environments, rather than deep semantic understanding and real-time relevance optimization.

#### Abstract
> Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

#### Abstract
> This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public
availability.

- **Submitted**: 2025-10-29 02:12:18
- **Topic Keywords**: queries
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) and Large Language Models (LLMs), which is somewhat related to the user's interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and query understanding. However, the paper's primary focus on KBQA and outcome-only supervision is not directly aligned with the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval (IR) and Search technologies.

#### Abstract
> Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

- **Reason**: This paper is not directly related to your research interests in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, or Natural Language Processing. While it involves machine learning, the focus is on automatic tuning of storage systems, which is outside your primary areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> Automatically configuring storage systems is hard: parameter spaces are large
and conditions vary across workloads, deployments, and versions. Heuristic and
ML tuners are often system specific, require manual glue, and degrade under
changes. Recent LLM-based approaches help but usually treat tuning as a
single-shot, system-specific task, which limits cross-system reuse, constrains
exploration, and weakens validation. We present StorageXTuner, an LLM
agent-driven auto-tuning framework for heterogeneous storage engines.
StorageXTuner separates concerns across four agents - Executor (sandboxed
benchmarking), Extractor (performance digest), Searcher (insight-guided
configuration exploration), and Reflector (insight generation and management).
The design couples an insight-driven tree search with layered memory that
promotes empirically validated insights and employs lightweight checkers to
guard against unsafe actions. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on
RocksDB, LevelDB, CacheLib, and MySQL InnoDB with YCSB, MixGraph, and TPC-H/C.
Relative to out-of-the-box settings and to ELMo-Tune, StorageXTuner reaches up
to 575% and 111% higher throughput, reduces p99 latency by as much as 88% and
56%, and converges with fewer trials.

- **Topic Keywords**: rag
- **Reason**: This paper focuses on sign language data acquisition and curation using vision-language models, which is not directly related to the user's core research themes in Information Retrieval, Search technologies, and Natural Language Processing. While it involves some aspects of data mining, the context and application are quite different from the user's interests.

#### Abstract
> Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

#### Abstract
> Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

- **Reason**: This paper focuses on evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using a new benchmark called RiddleBench. While it touches on the topic of language understanding, it is primarily concerned with assessing the logical deduction and spatial awareness of LLMs, which is not directly related to information retrieval, search technologies, or user behavior modeling. The paper's relevance to your research interests is limited.

#### Abstract
> Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

#### Abstract
> We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

#### Abstract
> Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming, its value in argumentative domains such as law remains
underexplored. We present an empirical study of verifier-based TTS methods for
legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five benchmarks. Using a family of 7
reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level (Best-of-$N$) and process-level
(tree search) verification under realistic low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis
systematically investigates how verifier utility is affected by key properties
such as domain specialization, model size, and supervision type
(process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when applied across
different roles.

While it involves deep semantic understanding, the context is specific to patent writing and regulatory compliance, making it only loosely relevant to your research.

#### Abstract
> Although AI drafting tools have gained prominence in patent writing, the
systematic evaluation of AI-generated patent content quality represents a
significant research gap. To address this gap, We propose to evaluate patents
using regulatory compliance, technical coherence, and figure-reference
consistency detection modules, and then generate improvement suggestions via an
integration module. The framework is validated on a comprehensive dataset
comprising 80 human-authored and 80 AI-generated patents from two patent
drafting tools. Evaluation is performed on 10,841 total sentences, 8,924
non-template sentences, and 554 patent figures for the three detection modules
respectively, achieving balanced accuracies of 99.74%, 82.12%, and 91.2%
against expert annotations. Additional analysis was conducted to examine defect
distributions across patent sections, technical domains, and authoring sources.
Section-based analysis indicates that figure-text consistency and technical
detail precision require particular attention. Mechanical Engineering and
Construction show more claim-specification inconsistencies due to complex
technical documentation requirements. AI-generated patents show a significant
gap compared to human-authored ones. While human-authored patents primarily
contain surface-level errors like typos, AI-generated patents exhibit more
structural defects in figure-text alignment and cross-references.

While it involves Natural Language Processing, the specific application and methodology are not directly related to your core areas of interest.

#### Abstract
> Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

#### Abstract
> The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

#### Abstract
> Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

#### Abstract
> ZK-SenseLM is a secure and auditable wireless sensing framework that pairs a
large-model encoder for Wi-Fi channel state information (and optionally mmWave
radar or RFID) with a policy-grounded decision layer and end-to-end
zero-knowledge proofs of inference. The encoder uses masked spectral
pretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal
alignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens.
To reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated
selective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is
registered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving
pipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version
binding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the
quantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and
confidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a
gateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates
with differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization
without weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are
part of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion,
respiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1
and calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and
rejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification.
