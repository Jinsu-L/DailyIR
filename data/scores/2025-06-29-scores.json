        "abstract": "Efficiently ranking relevant items from large candidate pools is a\ncornerstone of modern information retrieval systems -- such as web search,\nrecommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation. Listwise rerankers, which\nimprove relevance by jointly considering multiple candidates, are often limited\nin practice: either by model input size constraints, or by degraded quality\nwhen processing large sets. We propose a model-agnostic method for fast\nreranking large sets that exceed a model input limits. The method first\npartitions candidate items into overlapping blocks, each of which is ranked\nindependently in parallel. Implicit pairwise comparisons are then derived from\nthese local rankings. Finally, these comparisons are aggregated to construct a\nglobal ranking using algorithms such as Winrate or PageRank. Experiments on\nTREC DL-2019 show that our method achieves an nDCG@10 of 70.88 compared to the\n57.68 for full-context listwise approach using gpt-4.1-mini as long-context\nmodel, while reducing latency from 21 to 8 seconds.\n  The implementation of the algorithm and the experiments is available in the\nrepository: https://github.com/V3RGANz/jointrank",

The LiveRAG\nChallenge hosted at SIGIR'25 aims to advance RAG research using a fixed corpus\nand a shared, open-source LLM. We propose a modular pipeline that operates on\ninformation nuggets-minimal, atomic units of relevant information extracted\nfrom retrieved documents. This multistage pipeline encompasses query rewriting,\npassage retrieval and reranking, nugget detection and clustering, cluster\nranking and summarization, and response fluency enhancement. This design\ninherently promotes grounding in specific facts, facilitates source\nattribution, and ensures maximum information inclusion within length\nconstraints. In this challenge, we extend our focus to also address the\nretrieval component of RAG, building upon our prior work on multi-faceted query\nrewriting. Furthermore, for augmented generation, we concentrate on improving\ncontext curation capabilities, maximizing the breadth of information covered in\nthe response while ensuring pipeline efficiency. Our results show that\ncombining original queries with a few sub-query rewrites boosts recall, while\nincreasing the number of documents used for reranking and generation beyond a\ncertain point reduces effectiveness, without improving response quality.",

In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking.\nExisting gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures,\nleading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities.\nBuilding on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel\ngender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to\naddress existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed\nmetric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a\nsubset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender\nbias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.\nOur extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our\nproposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to\nprevious metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for\nGrep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa\nagreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating\nLLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias\nannotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust\nframework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.",

However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static\nretrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic\nrecommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which\nintegrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To\nbetter understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG\nleverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that\nsummarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural\nLanguage Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between\ncandidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent\nthat summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that\ngenerates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate\nARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG\nsignificantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving\nup to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an\nablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG.

        "abstract": "A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to\nevaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited\nstability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we\nargue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire\nModeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that\nQM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate\nthat it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.\nExperiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can\nindeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that\nlarger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and\ngenerally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM.

We construct a\nlarge dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer\nfeature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature\nselection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the\npresence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly\ndistinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in\nMT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative\nconjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%\nclassification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and\nNMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower\nlexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic\nLLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by\nChinese firms and their foreign counterparts.",

        "abstract": "Automated content-aware layout generation -- the task of arranging visual\nelements such as text, logos, and underlays on a background canvas -- remains a\nfundamental yet under-explored problem in intelligent design systems. While\nrecent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have\nshown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack\ngrounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic\nalignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a\nretrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that\nintegrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative\nagentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a\nstructured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to\npropose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates\nthe layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted\nrefinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using\nLangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in\nsemantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness,\nelement alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines\nsuch as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval\naugmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable,\ninterpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.",

To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various\nexplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide\nhuman-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding\nof these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a\ncomprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods\nbased on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,\ndecoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in\nterms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further\nexplores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.\nFinally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and\nfuture directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing\ntransparent and responsible LLMs.",

However, the\nlack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM\nevaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world\napplications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks,\noverlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,\nhomophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a\nnovel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.\nWe systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,\nintroduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment\nthe dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware\nevaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to\nenhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing\nand detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing\nsignificant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.\nThe use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment\nunder various speech-specific scenarios.

        "abstract": "The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian\nclassical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In\nthis work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67\nprominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a\ntransformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the\nsemantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature\nset encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric\nmeasures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a\nvast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the\ndata through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving\npoem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level\nclassification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,\nrevealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate\nthreshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly\nconfident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at\nlower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational\nforms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The\nresults illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification\nand the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general\ncomputational literature research. This research will facilitate further\nresearch on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative\nmodeling of Persian poetry.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert\nmedical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models\nrely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the\ncomplexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In\nclinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic\nhypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just\nlearned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final\ndiagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential\nDiagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New\nEngland Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases\ninto stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case\nabstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper\nmodel that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is\nassessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician\nvisits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator\n(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,\nproposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,\ncost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%\ndiagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist\nphysicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to\nphysicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum\naccuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO\ngeneralize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and\nLlama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively\nand act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in\nclinical care.",

We introduce adapted relational graph convolutions\noperating on an extended and enriched version of the original citation graph\nthat allow the topological integration of semantic meta-information.

Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs\npreserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and\ngenerate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a\nseparate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response\nlatency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available\npaired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs\ncompared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To\naddress this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality\nexpert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk\nfirst adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality\nload within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized\nsingle-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.\nAs a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the\noriginal LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of\nover 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par\nwith modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within\n0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/talkking/DeepTalk.",

        "abstract": "Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent\nyears, with words such as \"delve,\" \"intricate,\" and \"crucial\" showing\nsignificant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely\nattributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in\nthe discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in\nfrequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.\nThe present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve\nthe replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, \"crucial\"\nreplacing \"essential\" and \"key,\" or whether they reflect broader semantic and\npragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective \"important\"\nshows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze\ndecreasing lexical items. Our analysis of \"collapsing\" words reveals a more\ncomplex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts\nwith the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of\nlanguage change contribute to our understanding of how language technology\ncontinues to shape human language.",

To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{R}efinement-oriented\n\\textbf{C}ritique \\textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to\ntrain critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where\ncritiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its\nresponses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these\nrefinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By\nfocusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need\nfor direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving\nmeaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,\ndialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,\nand code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional\nmethods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement\noutcomes.

        "title": "Analyzing and Fine-Tuning Whisper Models for Multilingual Pilot Speech Transcription in the Cockpit",
        "abstract": "The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to\nsignificant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition\n(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The\npre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few\nepochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong\ngeneralization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does\nsuffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the\ncockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual\nconversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy\nof cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85\nminutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings\nwith pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men\nspeaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we\npropose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve\nWord Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,\nutilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).\nHereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \\% (pretrained whisper Large model without\nnormalization baseline) to 26.26\\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the\nproposed normalization scheme).",

        "abstract": "Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on\nend-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits\ntheir real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can\ncause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by\ninvestigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire\ntool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools\nand generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through\nextensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors\nat each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than\nthose based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size\ndoes not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents\nmore vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights\nthe importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for\nfuture LLM development and evaluation.",

Building on this line of research, we\nintroduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed\nto investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human\nneeds. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to\napprove or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives\nare constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,\nwhich categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of\nsix LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,\nsuggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation\nof the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows\nvarying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with\nsome models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities.
